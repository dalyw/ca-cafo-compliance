| Total Manure     | Total Nitrogen   | Total Phosphorus   | Total Potassium   | Total Salts      |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Exported (tons)* | Exported (lbs)** | Exported (lbs)**   | Exported (lbs)**  | Exported (lbs)** |

* The Total Manure (tons) should be calculated as the sum of all manure transferred offsite as reported in all the Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests for the reporting period. 

** Total (N, P, K, Salts) (lbs) = Sum of (N, P, K, Salts) for each manure export event based on (Manure(tons) x 2000Ib/ton) x ((100-moistureo/o)/100) x (N, P, K, and Ash) Concentration (%, dry weight)/ 
100 using the samples closest in date to the export event. 

## B. Estimated Total Process Wastewater_Transferred Offsite

* The Total Manure (gals) should be calculated as the sum of all manure transferred offsite as reported in all the Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests for the reporting period. ** Total (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, TDS) (lbs)= Sum of (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, TDS) for each wastewater export event based on (Process Wastewater(gals) x 8.33Ib/gal) x (N03-N 
or TKN, P, K, TDS) x 10-6 using the samples closest in date to the export event.
