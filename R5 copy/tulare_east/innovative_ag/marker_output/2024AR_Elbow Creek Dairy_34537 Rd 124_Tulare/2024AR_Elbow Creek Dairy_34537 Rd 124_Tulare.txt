## Elbow Creek Dairy 2024 Estimated Manure And Process Wastewater/Nutrients Transferred Off-Site (Attachment C) A. Estimated Total Manure Transferred Offsite

| Total Manure  Exported (tons)*   | Total Nitrogen  Exported (lbs)**   | Total Phosphorus  Exported (lbs)**   | Total Potassium  Exported (lbs)**   | Total Salts   |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Exported (lbs)**                 |                                    |                                      |                                     |               |
| 10,536                           | 270,645.13                         | 88,369.53                            | 250,583.42                          | 6,770,440.47  |

- The Total Manure (tons) should be calculated as the sum of all manure transferred offsite as reported in all the Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests for the reporting period. 

•• Total (N, P, K, Salts) (lbs) = Sum of (N, P, K, Salts) for each manure export event based on (Manure(tons) x 2000Ib/ton) x ((1 00-moisture¾)/100) x (N, P, K, and Ash) Concentration (%, dry weight)/ 
100 using the samples closest in date to the export event. 

## B. Estimated Tot Al Process Wastewater Transferred Offsite

| Total Process  Wastewater   | Total Nitrogen   | Total Phosphorus   | Total Potassium   | Total TDS        |
|-----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Exported {gal)*             | Exported (lbs)** | Exported (lbs)**   | Exported (lbs)**  | Exported {lbs)** |

- The Total Manure (gals) should be calculated as the sum of all manure transferred offsite as reported in all the Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests for the reporting period. 

.. Total (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, TDS) (lbs) = Sum of (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, TDS) for each wastewater export event based on (Process Wastewater(gals) x 8.33Ib/gal) x (N03-N 
or TKN, P, K, TDS) x 10-6 using the samples closest in date to the export event.
