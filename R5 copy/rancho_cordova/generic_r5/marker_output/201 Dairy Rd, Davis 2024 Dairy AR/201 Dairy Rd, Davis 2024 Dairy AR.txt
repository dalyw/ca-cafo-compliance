## Re: 2024 Annual Report For The Uc Davis Animal Science Dairy **Facilities**

Enclosed are the completed documents for the submission of the Annual Report for the UC Davis Animal Science Dairy at the University of California, Davis, for January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 (Attachment A). This submission fulfills the annual reporting requirement under the Waste Discharge Requirements General Order for Existing Milk Cow Dairies (Order No. R5-2013-0122). As of December 21, 2018, the Central Valley Water Board approved the merger of the UC Davis Animal Science Beef Feedlot and Beef Teaching Facility with the UC Davis Dairy under the Reissued General Order. Based on this merger, the 2024 Annual Report covers the Dairy, Beef Feedlot, and Beef Teaching Facilities. This submittal includes the following attachments:
Attachment A - Annual Dairy Report for 2024 Attachment B - Analytical Laboratory Reports Attachment C - Manure Manifest The following sections describe the Nutrient Management Plan, Supply Water, Waste Management, and billing information for the UC Davis Animal Science Dairy Facilities. No parcels have been used for land application for at least 5 years.

## Nutrient Management Plan

The Nutrient Management Plan (Plan) was last updated in 2015. The Plan was prepared and approved by a certified nutrient management specialist, and a copy is maintained on-site. The Plan was not updated with the recent facility merger discussed above, as the facilities have no active land application activities, nor any plans for the future.

## Supply Water

Supply water for the production facility is supplied by the campus's domestic water system. It comes from six on-campus wells and surface water from the Sacramento River. UC Davis tests the campus domestic water supply (Water System No. 5710009) as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the State Water Resources Control Board Division of Drinking Water. The analytical data for the supply water is included in Attachment B. The supply water used at the Dairy Facilities is solely for animal consumption. It was not used for irrigation on nearby properties (G-tract). No irrigation water was used for the G-tract parcel planted with wheat hay, and therefore, no sample was collected for nitrate-nitrite in 2024.

## Waste Management

Liquid waste and stormwater runoff from the Animal Science Dairy production facility and the Beef Feedlot discharge to the sanitary sewer, which is treated by the campus National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted Wastewater Treatment Plant
(Permit \# CA0077895).  Updated Waste Management Plans were submitted to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board in March 2019 for the Beef Feedlot and the Beef Teaching Facility. Manure was not applied to land during 2024 but was manifested off-site to a farm. Therefore, no stormwater discharge samples were collected. The stockpiled manure was sampled twice in 2024 and is presented in Attachment B.

## Permit Billing Information

Since this submittal includes both the UC Davis Animal Science Beef herd and the UC Davis Dairy herd, under the reissued General Order, we included the herd breakdown numbers for billing purposes below.  Also, the UC Davis Facilities are California Dairy Quality Assurance Program (CDQAP) certified, which should include an annual permit fee discount.
