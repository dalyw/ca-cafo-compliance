## Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifest For Existing Milk Cow Dairies

Instructions:

1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination.  A hauling event may last for several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.

4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.
