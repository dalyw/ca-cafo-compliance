## Annual Reporting Notes And Limitations

Application volumes used in the 2024 Annual Report are reduced by 25 percent from volumes recorded in the irrigation records to account for the portion of water that runs off the fields and is recirculated into the process wastewater pond. Field 1 was not planted during the 2024 reporting year, and there were no land applications to Field 1. See the Notes section of the Annual Report (Exhibit 2, Page 43) for additional details regarding the data entered into the Annual Report.
