No freshwater or process wastewater was applied to the forage crop on Fields 2 and 3 during the reporting year. Irrigation wells IR-6, IR-7, IR-8, IR-9 and IR-10 were not operating when irrigation well samples were collected during the 2024 reporting year. Analytical data from samples collected from these wells during previous reporting years (2021 and 2022) were used for freshwater applications from these wells. Fresh water samples are not analyzed for total nitrogen; therefore, the nitrate-nitrogen concentration for each source was entered as the total nitrogen concentration for land applications of fresh water. For each field, the volume of fresh water and process water was totaled for each quarter and entered as a single land application event for each quarter. Dates for each individual land application event are included in Exhibit 3. Due to the amount of process wastewater and fresh water that runs off the fields to the tailwater return system during irrigation events, application volumes were decreased by one-third of what was recorded in the land application records when this runoff was observed. All manure exports were entered as a single event since the operator, hauling entity, and recipient were the same for each export. The applied-to-removed nitrogen ratio exceeded 1.4 for the following fields/crops during the 2024 reporting year: The applied-to-removed nitrogen ratio for the entire dairy was 1.24 for the 2024 reporting year.\n\n## Groundwater Reporting\n\nGroundwater monitoring reports are submitted quarterly to the RWQCB and Solano County pursuant to the *Large Confined Animal Facility Standards* (Solano County Code, Chapter 27, Article IV, Section 27-400) under separate cover. \n\n## Stormwater Reporting\n\nNo stormwater discharges occurred during the reporting period. \n\n| -   | Field 4 Forage   | 2.22   |\n|-----|------------------|--------|\n| -   | Field 4 Corn     | 1.71   |\n| -   | Field 5 Forage   | 2.23   |\n| -   | Field 6 Corn     | 1.47   |\n| -   | Field 8 Corn     | 1.48   |\n| -   | Field 9 Forage   | 1.43   |\n| -   | Field 11 Corn    | 1.56   |\n\nP:\\Projects\\2013\\71328 HD Ranch Compliance\\Reports\\Annual Reports\\2024\\_HD Ranch_2024 Annual Report w Cover Letter_063025.doc\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n| Annual Report - General Order No. R5-2007-0035 Reporting period 01/01/2024 to 12/31/2024.   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| ATTACHMENTS   |\n|---------------|\n\n## A.
