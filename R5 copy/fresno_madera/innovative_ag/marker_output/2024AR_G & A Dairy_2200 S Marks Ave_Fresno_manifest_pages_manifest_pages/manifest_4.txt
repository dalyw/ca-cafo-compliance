Instructions:

2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination. 

3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event. 

4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.
