INTERPRETATION Page two of three
is Your Compost StabIe7
Respiration Rate
64 Moderate-seIected use mg CO2-Cig OMiday
The respiration rate is a measurement of the biodegradation rate of the organic matter in the sampIe (as received).
The respiration rate is determined by measuring the rate at which CO2 is reIeased under optimized moisture and
temperature conditions.
is Your Compost Mature7
AmmoniaNNitrateN ratio Composting to stabiIize carbon can occur at such a rapid rate that sometimes phytotoxins remain in
29 immature the compost and must be neutraIized before using in high concentrations or in high-end uses. This
Ammonia N ppm step is caIled curing. TypicaIly ammonia is in excess with the break-down of organic materiaIs resuIting
1600 immature in an increase in pH. This combination resuIts in a loss of voIatiIe ammonia (it smeIls). Once this toxic
Nitrate N ppm ammonia has been reduced and the pH drops, the microbes convert the ammonia to nitrates. A low
55 mature ammonia high nitrate score is indicative of a mature compost, however there are many exceptions.
For exampIe, a compost with a low pH (7) wiIl retain ammonia, whiIe a compost with high lime content
can lose ammonia before the organic fraction becomes stabIe. Composts must first be stabIe before
curing indicators appIy.
Cucumber Bioassay
0.0 Percent Cucumbers are chosen for this test because they are saIt toIerant and very sensitive to ammonia
and organic acid toxicity. Therefore, we can germinate seeds in high concentrations of compost to
measure phytotoxic effects without soIubIe saIts being the limiting factor. Vatues above 80 for both percent emergence and
vigor are indicative of a weIl-cured compost. Exceptions incIude very high saIts that affect the cucumbers, excessive concentrations
of nitrates and other nutrients that wiIl be in range when formuIated to make a growing media.
Js Your Compost Safe Regarding HeaIth7
Fecal CoIiform
 1000 ig dry wt. Fecal coIiforms can survive in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and is commen in aIl initial
compost piIes. Most human pathogens occur from fecal matter and aIl fecal matter is loaded in fecal coIiforms. Therefore fecal
coIiforms are used as an indicator to determine if the chosen method for pathogen reduction (heat for compost) has met the
requirements of sufficient temperature, time and mixing. If the fecal coIiforms are reduced to beIow 1000 per gram dry wt. it is
assumed aIl others pathogens are eIiminated. Potential probIems are that fecal coIiform can regrow during the curing phase or
during shipping. This is because the conditions are now more favorabIe for growth than during the composting process.
SaImoneIla Bacteria
Less than3 3/4gdrywt. SaImoneIla is not onIy another indicator organism but aIso a toxic microbe. It has been used in the
case of biosoIids industry to determine adequate pathogen reduction.
MotaIs
Pass The ten heavy metaIs listed in the EPA 503 reguIations are chosen to determine if compost
can be appIied to ag land and handIed without toxic effects. Most high concentrations of heavy metaIs are derived from
woodwaste feedstock such as chrome-arsenic treated or lead painted demoIition wood. BiosoIids are rareIy a probtem.
Does Your Compost Provide Nutrients or Organic Matter7
Nutrients (NP205K20)
7.8 High nutrient content
This vaiue is the sum of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Reported units are consistent with those
found on fertiIizer formuIations. A sum greater than 5 is indicative of a compost with high nutrient content, and best used to suppIy
nutrients to a receiving soil. A sum beIow 2 indicates low nutrient content, and is best-used to improve soil structure via the
addition of organic matter. Most compost faIls between 2 and 5.

INTERPRETATION Page three of three
Agindex (Nutrients/NatCl)

2 Low nutrient ratio Composts with low Agindex vaIues have high concentrations of sodium and/or chtoride
compared to nutrients, Repeated use of a compost with a low Agindex ( 2) may resuIt in sodium and/or chIoride
acting as the limiting facter compared to nutrients, governing appIication rates. These composts may be used on weIl-draining
soiIs and/or with saIt-toIerant pIants. Additional nutrients form another source may be needed if the apptication rate is limited by
sodium or chIoride. If the Agindex is above 10, nutrients optimal for pIant growth wiIl be avaiIabIe without concern of sodium and/or
chIoride toxicity. Composts with an Agindex of above 10 are good for increasing nutrient leveIs for aIl soiIs. Most composts score
between 2 and 10, Concentrations of nutrients, sodium, and chIoride in the receiving soil shoutd be considered when determining
compost appIication rates. The Agindex is a product of feedstock quaIity. Feedstock from dairy manure, marine waste, industrial
wastes, and haIophytic pIants are likeIy to produce a finished compost with a low Agindex.

PIant AvaitabIe Nitrogen (lbs/ton)

10 Average N Provider PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen (PAN) is catcuIated by estimating the reIease rate of Nitrogen from
the organic fraction of the compost. This estimate is based on the respiration rate, ammonia, and nitrate vaIues. Despite the PAN
vaIue of the compost, additional sources of Nitrogen may be needed during he growing season to offset the Nitrogen demand
of the microbes present in the compost. With ampIe nutrients these microbes can further breakdown organic matter in the
compost and reIease bound Nitregen. Nitrogen demand based on a high C/N ratio is not considered in the PAN catcuIation
because additional Nitrogen shouId aIways be suppIemented to the receiving soil when composts with a high C/N ratio are appIied.
CIN Ratio

13 Indicates maturity As a guiding principal, a C/N ratio beIow 14 indicates maturity and above 14 indicates
immaturity, however, there are many exceptions. Large woodchips (6.3mm), bark, and redwood are sIow to breakdown and
therefore can resuIt in a reIativeIy stabIe product whiIe the C/N ratio vaIue is high. AdditionaIly, some composts with chicken manure
and/or green grass feedstocks can start with a C/N ratio beIow 15 and are very unstabIe. A C/N ratio beIow 10 suppIies Nitrogen,
whiIe a ratio above 20 can depIete Nitrogen from the soil. The rate at which Nitrogen wiIl be reIeased or used by the microbes is
indicated by the respiration rate. If the respiration rate is too high the transfer of Nitrogen wiIl not be controIabIe.

SoIubIe Nutrients & SaIts (ECS wiw dw - mmhos/cm)

22 High saIts This vaIue refers to aIl soIubIe ions incIuding nutrients, sodium, chIoride and some
soIubIe organic compounds. The concentration of saIts wiIl change due to the reIease of saIts from the organic matter as it degrades,
voIatitization of ammonia, decomposition of soIubIe organics, and conversion of moIecuIar structure. High saIts high Agindex is
indicative of a compost high in readiIy avaiIabIe nutrients. The appIication rate of these composts shouId be limited by the optimum
nutrient vaIue based on soil anaIysis of the receiving soil. High SaIts low Agindex is indicative of a compost tow in nutrients with
high concentrations of sodium and/or chIoride. Limit the appIication rate according to the toxicity level of thesodium and/or chIoride.
Low saIts indicates that the compost can be appIied without risking saIt toxicity, is likeIy a good source of organic matter, and that
nutrients wiIl reIease sIowIy over time.

Lime Content (lbs. per ton)

93 High lime content Compost high in lime or carbonates are often those produced from chicken manure (layers)
ash materiaIs, and lime products. These are exceIlent products to use on a receiving soil where lime has been recommended by
soil anaIysis to raise the pH. Composts with a high time content shouId be cIoseIy considered for pH requirements when formuIating
potting mixes.

Physical Properties
Percent Ash

36.5 Average ash content Ash is the non-organic fraction of a compost. Most composts contain approximateIy 50
ash (dry weight basis). Compost can be high in ash content for many reasons incIuding excess mineriIzation(oId compost),
contamination with soil base material during turning, poor quaIity feedstock, and soil or mineral products added. Finding the source
and reducing high ash content is often the fastest means to increasing nutrient quaIity of a compost.

ParticIe Size 6.3 MM (0.25)

48.1 May restrict use Large particIes may restrict use for potting soiIs, goIf course topdressings, seed-starter
mixes, and where a fine size distribution is required. Composts with large particIes can stiIl be used as exceIlent additions to fieId
soiIs, shrub mixes and muIches.
