E. Water Quality Sampling
The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and
Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling
and data analysis procedures.
Surface Water Sampling

Y Check the box that applies. Xcroup Monitoring Program Individual Monitoring Plan
If you are not identified as participating ina Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual
surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during
or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
events shall be at least 14 days apart.

14. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including

any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity ofthe confined

facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measure pent devices, etc. )

Groundwater Sampling
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State hei if Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box below that applies )
_ Reporting groundwater sampling results this year.
Y n Table 2, list the samples that have been collected to date,
Y In Table 3, report your results.
Y Attach the lab reports for each sample reported in Table 3.
