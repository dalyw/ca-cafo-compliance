The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compliance updates, demonstrate that the facility is ready for the
rainy season, document required water quality monitoring and actions taken to correct identified problems, and to
demonstrate that each facility is operating in compliance with the requirements of Order No, R2-2016-0031
(General Permit).
Any discharges of waste, wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human health or the
environment, must be verbally reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board
Spill Hotline at (510) 622-2369 and to the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) at (800) 852-7550.
Within 14 business days, a written report describing the incident and resulting corrective actions must be
submitted, as indicated below.
By November 30 of each year, please complete this form to document compliance and submit it to.

events shail be at least 14 days apart.
1.. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including

Groundwater Sampling
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
                 Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
                 frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
                   Check the box below that applies
                 O Reporting groundwater sampling results this year.
