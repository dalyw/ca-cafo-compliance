Any discharges of waste wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human heaIth or the
environment must be verbaIly reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board

Groundwater SampIing

AIl faciIities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampIing (even if you are participating in

a group monitoring program). Any existing representative weIls located within the confined faciIity incIuding
domestic and agricuItural suppIy weIls shaIl be sampIed 4 times total approximateIy 6 months apart.
ResuIts of groundwater sampIes coIlected consistentIy with the sampIing protocoIs and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County HeaIth Department or by the County miIk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of coIlecting additional sampIes. The sampIe must be representative
of groundwater weIl conditions (i.e. not disinfected).

Groundwater sampIes shaIl be anaIyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of HeaIth
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff
