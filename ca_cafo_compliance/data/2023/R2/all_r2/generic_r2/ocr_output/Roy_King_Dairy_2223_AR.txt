Any discharges of waste wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human heaIth or the
environment must be verbaIly reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board

Y Check the box that appIies roup Monitoring Program O Individual Monitoring PIan
If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program you are responsibIe for individual

surface water sampIing as required in the General Permit Attachment A. SampIing shaIl take pIace during
or directIy foIlowing each of 3 major storm events after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. SampIing
events shaIl be at least 14 days apart.

Groundwater SampIing

AIl faciIities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampIing (even if you are participating in

a group monitoring program). Any existing representative weIls located within the confined faciIity incIuding
domestic and agricuItural suppIy weIls shaIl be sampIed 4 times total approximateIy 6 months apart.
ResuIts of groundwater sampIes coIlected consistentIy with the sampIing protocoIs and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County HeaIth Department or by the County miIk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of coIlecting additional sampIes. The sampIe must be representative
of groundwater weIl conditions (i.e. not disinfected).

Groundwater sampIes shaIl be anaIyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of HeaIth
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff
