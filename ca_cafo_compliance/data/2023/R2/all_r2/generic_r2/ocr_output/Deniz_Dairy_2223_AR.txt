The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compIiance updates, demonstrate that the faciIity is ready for the ,
rainy season, document required water quaIity monitoring and actions taken to correct identified probIems, and to
demonstrate that each faciIity is operating in compIiance with the requirements of Order No. R2-2016-0031
(General Permit).
Any discharges of waste, wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human heaIth or the
environment, must be verbaIly reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board

E. Water QuaIity SampIing ,

The information beIow summarizes the water quaIity sampIing resuIts, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). PIease refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampIing

and data anaIysis procedures.

Surface Water SampIing
v Check the box that appIies. AGroup Monitoring Program 0 Individual Monitoring PIan

lf you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsibIe for individual

surface water sampIing as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. SampIing shaIl take pIace during

or directIy foIlowing each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. SampIing
events shaIl be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampIing resuIts in the tabIe beIow or attach simiIar documentation, incIuding
any lab reports. AIso attach a map of the sampIing locations, incIuding the proximity of the confined
faciIities and land appIication areas.

2. Describe your sampIing methods (fieId equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc. ).

lf yes, identify the resuIts of the additional sampIes conducted to isoIate the probIem, and describe
the findings. IncIude a detaiIed description of the identified poIlutant source and corrective actions
taken (attach additional pages if necessary).
Groundwater SampIing.
AIl faciIities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampIing (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative weIls located within the confined faciIity, incIuding
domestic and agricuItural suppIy weIls, shaIl be sampIed 4 times total, approximateIy 6 months apart.
ResuIts of groundwater sampIes coIlected consistentIy with the sampIing protocoIs and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County HeaIth Department or by the County miIk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of coIlecting additional sampIes. The sampIe must be representative
of groundwater weIl conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater sampIes shaIl be anaIyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of HeaIth
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box beIow that appIies.
