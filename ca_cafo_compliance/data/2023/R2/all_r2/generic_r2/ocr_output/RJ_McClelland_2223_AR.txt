The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compliance updates, demonstrate that the facility is ready for the
rainy season, document required water quality monitoring and actions taken to correct identified problems, and to
demonstrate that each facility is operating in compliance with the requirements of Order No. R2-2016-0031
(General Permit).
Any discharges of waste, wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human health or the
environment, must be verbally reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board

E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling

and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling
v Check the box that applies Group Monitoring Program C Individual Monitoring Plan

f you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during

or dicectly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
event&shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any lab heports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined
facilities ahd land application areas.

Groundwater Sampling.
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampied 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted fo the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box below that applies.
