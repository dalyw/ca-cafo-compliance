Did any surface water samples exceed General Order benchmarks?
If yes, identify the results of the additional samples conducted to isolate the problem,and describe
the findings.Include a detailed description of the identified pollutant source and corrective actions

Groundwater Sampling:
All facillties with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program).Any existing representative wells located within the confined facilityincluding
domestic and agricultural supply wells,shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g.for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples.The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e.not disinfected)
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Heaith
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
