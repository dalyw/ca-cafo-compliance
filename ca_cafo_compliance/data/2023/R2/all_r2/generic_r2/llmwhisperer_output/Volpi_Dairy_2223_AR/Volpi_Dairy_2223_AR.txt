    E. Water Quality Sampling 
   The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and 
    Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section II C, for 
    sampling and data analysis procedures. 

   Surface Water Sampling:     PARTICIPATING               IN SMARP 
   If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual 
    surface water sampling as required in General WDRs, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during or 
    directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events 
    shall be at least 14 days apart. 

    1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including 
       any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including proximity of the confined 
       facilities and land application areas. 
    2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.):

    Ground Water Sampling: 
    All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct ground water sampling (even if you are 
    participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the 
    confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, 
    approximately 6 months apart. A sample must be collected in the Fall and Spring, Results of 
    groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames 
    for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be 
    submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be 
    representative of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected). 

    Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health 
    Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.

    Note: If all sampling events have not been completed during the required time periods, future sampling is required 
    until all wells have been sampled a total of 4 times, approximately 6 months apart.
