D. Improvement Projects, Repairs and/or Corrective Measures

Describe any on-going or planned facility improvements for water quality protection, pollutant control, and/or to meet the conditions of the General WDRs. For each project, include a timeline for completion and indicate its status and progress made since the last Annual Report (attach additional pages if needed).

Replaced 180’ of gutters in the alleyways near milking barn.

Built new shed to cover manure pumping equipment and electrical panel near main pit.

Cleaned culverts - removed sediment from last rainy season and refreshed trenches to support proper overflow diversion to keep buffer zones clear.

Roof maintenance - replaced and repaired roof areas/tin to make sure no rain water would enter areas outside of maintained/scraped manure areas.

This year we will be working on developing and implementing a carbon farm plan. There will be updates to our current systems based on recommendations of the report. These changes will be reflected and reported in our next annual report.

E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling:

✓ Check the box that applies:   
☐ Group Monitoring Program   
☐ Individual Monitoring Plan

If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.):

Table 1: Surface Water Sampling Results

| Constituent | Benchmark | Sample I.D. | Date Collected | Result |  
|---|---|---|---|---|   
| Specific conductance | Below 2000 µS/cm |  |  |  |  
| Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3 + NH4+) | Below 1 ppm (or mg/l) and meets calculated unionized ammonia benchmark |  |  |  |  
| Unionized ammonia (NH3) as calculated | 0.025 mg/l |  |  |  |  
| pH | 6.5-8.5 |  |  |  |  
| Temperature (°C) | none |  |  |  |

| Total Coliform Bacteria | 1.1 MPN/100 ml | Spring Date collected: 7/22/20, 3/10/21 Well I.D. Nitrate Total Coliform Milk Barn < .40 < 1.0 Milk Barn < .40 < 1.0 |

Note: If all sampling events have not been completed during the required time periods, future sampling is required until all wells have been sampled a total of 4 times consecutively, approximately 6 months apart.

If reporting groundwater samples this year, fill out the section below:

Did any groundwater samples from this year exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
Have any wells had multiple samples exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A

If yes to both, additional sampling may be necessary to confirm the result, and Water Board Staff will follow up within 30 days of the Annual Report deadline to investigate the concern. In the area below, describe any additional information you may have about the contaminated well (attach additional pages if necessary).
