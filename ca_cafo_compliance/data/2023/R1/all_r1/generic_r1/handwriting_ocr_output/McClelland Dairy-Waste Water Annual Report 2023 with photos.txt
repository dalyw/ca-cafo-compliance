D. Miscellaneous

Are dead animals handled in a manner protective of surface water and groundwater quality? Yes ☐ No ☐

Description of Deficiencies (if any) or Additional Information:

A Manure Manifest form is required to be filled out and kept on the Facility if manure is hauled off the Facility. This is to ensure tracking of nutrients and ensure responsibility that manure is handled properly in a manner protective of water quality. Completed forms must be available to Regional Water Board staff during inspections and upon staff request. Has manure been hauled off site within the past year and is a Manure Manifest form on file at the Facility for this handling? Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A ☒

E. Photo Documentation per Monitoring and Reporting Plan

Please attach photo documentation of compliance with required preseason pollution prevention measures.

Photos of newly implemented pollution prevention measures to protect surface and groundwater shall be submitted. Examples of pollution prevention includes cleaning of manure ponds, storm water separation from manured areas, scraping of manured areas, covering manure piles, compost, and feed storage areas, impermeable ground covering in these storage areas to prevent groundwater contamination, stream zone protection, and any other best management practices or control measures for water quality protection.

Annually, please include dated photos of the watercourse assessment (Monitoring and Reporting Program, Section 1, Item A.7). This includes photos of riparian vegetation, streambanks, watercourse crossings, and any potential erosion that could discharge to watercourses. Photos are to show current water quality protection and any projects that are in progress to improve water quality. Page 6 of this Annual Report has space to explain improvement projects.

The objective of the Annual Report is to demonstrate that the Facility is ready for the wet season and will not discharge sediment and nutrients to surface waters or groundwater.

Photo Documentation of Preseason Best Management Practices is Attached ☒ Yes ☐ No

F. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling requirements, as presented in the Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP).

Surface Water Sampling  
Surface watercourses that flow through the Facility, including the production area, cropland, or pastures, must be sampled using grab samples at the point where watercourses enter and leave the property. Alternatively, if surface waters flow adjacent to the property but not through the property, and are located such that they could be impacted by activities at the Facility, the grab samples shall be collected upstream and downstream of the areas closest to the Facility. Sampling shall take place during or directly following each of three (3) major storm events, of one (1) inch or more per 24-hours, during the rainy season, beginning in the winter season of 2016-2017. Three (3) measurements of electrical conductivity taken three (3) minutes apart shall be recorded during each sampling event at each location. Total ammonia nitrogen, pH, and temperature shall be collected once at each sampling location for each sampling event during or following storm events described in this section above. The MRP requires recording of visual observations, such as changes in stream color or turbidity at the time of sampling. Please include those observations below or in an attachment.

Electrical Conductivity (EC) Mmhos  
Total Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3) as N, mg/L  
pH  
Temperature °C

Is this Facility in a group monitoring plan? Yes If so, which group? SMDRMD

Groundwater Well Sampling  
Representative wells currently used and located at the Facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled four (4) times total, approximately six (6) months apart. A sample must be collected in: (1) Spring 2017, (2) Fall 2017, (3) Spring 2018, and (4) Fall 2018. One (1) sample from each well shall be tested for the following parameters:

Constituent Units  
Nitrate mg/L  
Fecal Coliform Bacteria MPN/100mL

Has all surface and ground water quality sampling been completed as described in the Monitoring and Reporting Plan? Yes No NO MILKING COWS ON FACILITY

Have all water quality results from the past 12 months been attached? Yes No N/A

G. Best Management Practices  
(In this section please describe the current condition and effectiveness of management measures not previously described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Please attach additional sheets if more space is needed to fully answer these topics).

Manure Ponds: Are the liners of the manure ponds currently protective of water quality (free of weeds, animal burrows, and cracks that may disturb the liner)? Please describe: No changes to WQP

Do the manure ponds have sufficient storage capacity prior to the upcoming rainy season as required in the Order? Describe the method used to make this determination: yes, no changes to WQP

Please describe all new measures taken to prevent nuisances at the manure ponds. Nuisances include odors, breeding mosquitoes, damage from burrowing animals, damage from equipment during removal of solids, embankment settling, erosion seepage, excess weeds, algae, and other vegetation that could compromise the needed capacity or proper functioning of your facility and/or degrade water quality: No changes, annual inspection, weed removal

Riparian Protection: Are effective stream protections present in all pastures that prevent animal waste and sediment from entering waterways (example: bridges, culverts, rocked crossings, fencing out animals, water troughs away from streams, shade away from streams, extensive vegetation, revegetation of bare areas, etc.): Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A ☐

Describe current water quality issues on the Facility such as at stream crossings and riparian areas (example: stream bank trampling and compaction, soil erosion, lack of ground cover and riparian shade protection, and discharge of fecal matter, sediment, and nutrients): NO CURRENT ISSUES

Where there is evidence of impacts to designated beneficial uses, the Discharger must develop riparian management protection measures and implement best management practices to control adverse impacts to the beneficial uses. What gradual improvements are being done to resolve adverse impacts?  
Fencing to prevent cattle access to waterways + sensitive areas

Erosion Control: Please describe all other measures not previously described, that prevent and minimize the occurrence of erosion and discharge of manure, feed, waste, and soil particles from the Facility to surface or groundwater: No changes to WQP

Groundwater Protection: Describe new measures taken to protect groundwater from contamination at wellheads, sinkholes, and tile drains: No changes to WQP

Nutrient Management Planning:

In the past year, was manure and process water generated at your facility been applied to pastures, fields or crop lands at rates that are agronomically sound for the crop, soil, climate, special local situations, management system, and manure/process wastewater characteristics? Yes☑ No☐

Please explain: Manure is handled per CNMP / WQP Parameters

Please describe the measures taken to avoid surface runoff of manure constituents from the Facility's land application areas:  
Per CNMP manure is applied prior to the rainy season in a rotational manner. Buffer and exclusion zones are observed.

Describe the measures taken to separate or divert storm water from contacting manured areas, corrals, pens, and animal housing areas:  
Diversion ditches / Gutters

Describe the measures taken to minimize infiltration of manure-laden water into underlying soils within manured areas, corrals, pens, and animal housing areas:  
Corrals are winterized and bare areas are re-seeded

H. CEQA Mitigation Measures

The Order states that: "Areas specified in Confidential Appendix D of the CEQA document shall be surrounded with permanent fencing and rotationally grazed when soil conditions are dry. Dairy cattle within this permanent fencing shall not exceed 20 cattle for a maximum of two consecutive days for a rotation of once per 18-day period or more." Does the Facility implement these required CEQA mitigation measures identified in Order? Yes☑ No☐

The Order states that: "Also, the dirt road that bisects the area specified in Confidential Appendix D will be used only when dry. If visible erosion of the road surface or adjacent area occurs, then the use will be halted immediately until the road surface is restored, or is reseeded so that a thick growth of pasture grasses is established, or is covered with gravel or other material." Does the Facility implement these required CEQA mitigation measures identified in Order? Yes☑ No☐
