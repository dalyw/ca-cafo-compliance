H. Best Management Practices

In this section, pIease describe the condition and effectiveness of management measures not

previousIy described eIsewhere in this Annual Report. PIease attach additional sheets if more

space is needed to fuIly answer these topics.

1. Erosion Control PIease describe aIl other measures not previousIy described, that prevent
and minimize the occurrence of erosion and discharge of manure, feed, waste, and soil
particIes from the dairy to surface water or groundwaters.

We restrict animal access to steep areas during vunerabIe periods and keep away from areas
where water pooIs. We have managed rotational grazing. We have vegetative fiIter strips Av
pond area and surface water. We scrape manure area before rainy season. Good fencing for
anntenIlad neran andl AAA ntanrm uintar moinnff anntenl

2. Nuisance Control PIease describe aIl measures taken to prevent nuisances. IncIude
odors, breeding mosquitoes, damage from burrowing animaIs, damage from equipment
during removal of soIids, embankment settIing, erosion seepage, excess weeds, aIgae,
and other vegetation that couId compromise the needed capacity or proper functioning of
your faciIity and/or degrade water quaIity.

Good rodent control program. Practice weed vegetation management. SoIids are moved with a
tractor and manure wagon and a PTO pump via underground mainIine to aIl areas of the dairy.

3. Groundwater Protection Describe measures taken to protect groundwater from
contamination at weIlheads, sinkhoIes, and tiIe drains.

Manure is not appIied at or near weIl head. FIow of runoff is protected by cement around the
weIlhead. Standing water fIows away from the weIl head. Manure is kept away from areas
where not permitted by local restrictions. Dead animaIs are promptIy removed and are not buried

We do not appIy during wet events and we maintain a buffer of 200 from any standing water or
drainage.
7. Are the liners of the manure ponds protective of water quaIity (free of weeds, animal
burrows, and cracks that may disturb the liner)7 PIease describe-
Yes, We maintain the ponds annuaIly or as needed to remove any weeds or other debris to
maintain the integrity of the liner and cement tanks.
8. Do the manure ponds have sufficient storage capacity prior to the rainy season as
required in the GWDR2 Describe the method used to make this determination-

the dairys land appIication areas
We do not appIy during any rainy event. Has to be dry enough for nutrients to absorb.

areas, corraIs, pens, and animal housing areas
Rain water is captured and funneIed away with gutters and aIl cement corraIs drain to pond.
11.Describe the measures taken to minimize infiItration of manure-laden water into
underIying soiIs within manured areas, corraIs, pens, and animal housing areas.

The GWDR encourages water conservation. The Water QuaIity PIan, section J, discusses the

within the past year on the dairy incIuding pastures and cropIand that heIp to conserve water.
(ExampIes vegetate bare soil areas, use water efficientIy, repair leaks in a timeIy manner,
utiIize rain gutters on buiIdings and discharge the cIean stormwater to vegetated areas, infiItrate
cIean stormwater to recharge groundwater, use recycIed water, dry scrape manured areas,
catch rainwater in basins for re-use, practice no-tiIl on pastures and cropIands, reduce
freshwater use where possibIe, etc.)-
We practice a no tiIl on pastures and interseed where needed. Weaker pastures reseeded every 5-8
years. We strive to use water efficientIy and repair leaks as soon as possibIe. We dont over graze
so we can maintain ground moisture.
