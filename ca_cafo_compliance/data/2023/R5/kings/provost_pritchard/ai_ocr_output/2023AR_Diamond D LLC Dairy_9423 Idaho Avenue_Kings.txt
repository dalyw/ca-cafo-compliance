Notes:

1. Generated totals are the sum of what was applied to all land application areas and what was transferred to others. See Attachment E for individual field applications and Attachment G for individual transfers.

2. Dry tons are calculated by:

Dry Tons = Tons As-Is * (100-sample moisture %) / 100

3. Solid manure nutrient pounds applied are calculated by: Total (N,P,K,Salts) lbs = (Dry Tons)*((%N,P,K,Ash)/100)*2,000

4. Process wastewater nutrient pounds applied are calculated by: Total (P,K,Salts) lbs = (Gallons)*(P,K,TDS mg/l)*(8.337E-06) Total (N) lbs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+TKN mg/l)*(8.337E-06) 5. All solid manure applied is considered as the organic form of nitrogen. Inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen in process wastewater are calculated by: Inorganic N lbs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+NH4-N mg/l)*(8.337E-06) Organic N lbs = (Gallons)*(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)*(8.337E-06)

6. Estimated total salt content in solid manure is determined by fixed solids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disolved solids. These are not direct relationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary widely in a sample if corral dirt becomes part of the sample. Also, ash content is only required to be analyzed once every two years. The latest resultant value is applied to any subsequent applications.

Notes:

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season. PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Notes:

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season. PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Attachment D Results of Record-Keeping Requirements Planting and Harvest Data (Ref MRP Annual Report, General Section, Item 17, subitems B.3 a and b)

* - A crop's planting date is reported in the harvest year with the yield of that crop.

** - If no manure is applied to the crop within the year, harvest is not reported ( See Attachment E).

*** - For multiple year crops, a starting date is set to increment into annual periods.

Notes:

. The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.

Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in advance.

All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has not been performed.

Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating Procedures.

J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which contribute to the un-reliability of these values.

(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and 40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved metals.

Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.

Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.

RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.

· The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.

(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.

Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

The results in this report apply to the samples analyzed in accordance with the chain of custody document. This analytical report must be reproduced in its entirety.

Notes:

.The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.

Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in advance.

All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has not been performed.

Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating Procedures.

J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which contribute to the un-reliability of these values.

(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and 40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved metals.

· Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.

Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.

RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.

· The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.

(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.

Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

The results in this report apply to the samples analyzed in accordance with the chain of custody document. This analytical report must be reproduced in its entirety.

Notes:

. The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.

Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in advance.

All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has not been performed.

Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating Procedures.

J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which contribute to the un-reliability of these values.

(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and 40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved metals.

Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.

Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.

RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.

· The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.

(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.

Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

The results in this report apply to the samples analyzed in accordance with the chain of custody document. This analytical report must be reproduced in its entirety.
