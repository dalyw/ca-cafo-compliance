2023 Annual Report

Jersey Creek Dairy

This report contains information required to be submitted as outlined by the Annual Reporting section of the Revised Monitoring and Reporting Program No. R5-2013-0122 (pages MRP-12 through 14) for this dairy facility. This report is due by July 01 following the reporting year.

I. General Section

1. Reporting Period

This Annual Monitoring Report contains the required information for the period of January 01 through December 31. Field data contains information pertaining to crop activities for all crops harvested within this period. This allows for continuity of the winter crops.

2. Herd Profile and Housing of the Dairy

The maximum and average number and type of animals, whether in open confinement or housed under roof is provided in Attachment A.

3. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients Generated

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater generated for this period is provided in Attachment A.

4. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients Applied

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater applied for this period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual applications to each field (Item 17, Record Keeping) is provided in Attachment E.

5. Ratio of Total Nitrogen Applied to Removed for Land Application Areas

The ratio of total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied to land application areas and the total nitrogen removed by crop harvest is provided in Attachment C.

Also provided is the Plant Available Nitrogen (PAN) ratio which includes the inorganic nitrogen and calculates how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through mineralization for that crop. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

6. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients Transferred

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater transferred offsite for this period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual transfers are documented in Attachment G.

Transfer documentation can be found in Item 13, Manure Tracking Manifests.

7. Land Application Areas Without Manure Applications

The total number of acres and APN's for all land application areas that did not receive manure applications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

8. Land Application Areas With Manure Applications

The total number of acres and APN's for all land application areas that did receive manure applications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

Notes:

1. Generated totals are the sum of what was applied to all land application areas and what was transferred to others. See Attachment E for individual field applications and Attachment G for individual transfers .

2. Dry tons are calculated by:

Dry Tons = Tons As-Is * (100-sample moisture %) / 100

3. Solid manure nutrient pounds applied are calculated by: Total (N,P,K,Salts) lbs = (Dry Tons)*((%N,P,K,Ash)/100)*2,000

4. Process wastewater nutrient pounds applied are calculated by: Total (P,K,Salts) lbs = (Gallons)*(P,K,TDS mg/l)*(8.337E-06) Total (N) lbs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+TKN mg/l)*(8.337E-06) 5. All solid manure applied is considered as the organic form of nitrogen. Inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen in process wastewater are calculated by: Inorganic N lbs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+NH4-N mg/l)*(8.337E-06) Organic N lbs = (Gallons)*(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)*(8.337E-06)

6. Estimated total salt content in solid manure is determined by fixed solids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disolved solids. These are not direct relationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary widely in a sample if corral dirt becomes part of the sample. Also, ash content is only required to be analyzed once every two years. The latest resultant value is applied to any subsequent applications.

Notes:

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season. PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Notes:

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season. PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Attachment D Results of Record-Keeping Requirements Planting and Harvest Data (Ref MRP Annual Report, General Section, Item 17, subitems B.3 a and b)

* - A crop's planting date is reported in the harvest year with the yield of that crop.

** - If no manure is applied to the crop within the year, harvest is not reported ( See Attachment E).

*** - For multiple year crops, a starting date is set to increment into annual periods.
