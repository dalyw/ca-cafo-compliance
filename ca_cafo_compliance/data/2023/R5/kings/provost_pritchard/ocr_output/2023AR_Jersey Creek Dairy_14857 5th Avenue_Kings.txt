This report contains information required to be submitted as outIined by the Annual Reporting
section of the Revised Monitoring and Reporting Program No. R5-2013-0122 (pages MRP-12
through 14) for this dairy faciIity. This report is due by JuIy 01 foIlowing the reporting year.

l. General Section

1. Reporting Period

This Annual Monitoring Report contains the required information for the period of January
01 through December 31. FieId data contains information pertaining to crop activities for
aIl crops harvested within this period. This aIlows for continuity of the winter crops.

2. Herd ProfiIe and Housing of the Dairy

The maximum and average number and type of animaIs, whether in open confinement or
housed under roof is provided in Attachment A.

3. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Generated

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater generated for this period
is provided in Attachment A.

4. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients AppIied

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater appIied for this period is
provided in Attachment A.

Individual appIications to each fieId (Item 17, Record Keeping) is provided in Attachment
E.

5. Ratio of Total Nitrogen AppIied to Removed for Land AppIication Areas

The ratio of total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied to land appIication areas and the
total nitrogen removed by crop harvest is provided in Attachment C.

AIso provided is the PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen (PAN) ratio which incIudes the inorganic
nitrogen and caIcuIates how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the
pIant through mineraIization for that crop. This incIudes both what is appIied during that
growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.

6. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Transferred

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater transferred offsite for this
period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual transfers are documented in Attachment G.
Transfer documentation can be found in Item 13, Manure Tracking Manifests.

7. Land AppIication Areas Without Manure AppIications

The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did not receive
manure appIications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

8. Land AppIication Areas With Manure AppIications

The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did receive

6. Estimated total saIt content in soIid manure is determined by fixed soIids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disoIved soIids. These are
not direct reIationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary wideIy in a sampIe if corral dirt becomes part of the sampIe.
AIso, ash content is onIy required to be anaIyzed once every two years. The latest resuItant vaIue is appIied to any subsequent appIications.
