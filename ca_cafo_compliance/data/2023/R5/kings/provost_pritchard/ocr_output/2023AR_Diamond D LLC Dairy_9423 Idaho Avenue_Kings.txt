(GaIlons)(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)(8.337E-06)

6. Estimated total saIt content in soIid manure is determined by fixed soIids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disoIved soIids. These are

not direct reIationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary wideIy in a sampIe if corral dirt becomes part of the sampIe.

AIso, ash content is onIy required to be anaIyzed once every two years. The latest resuItant vaIue is appIied to any subsequent appIications.

Total BaIance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied onIy during the time of that crops growing season.

PAN BaIance Ratio is based on PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen appIied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the pIant through

mineraIization. This incIudes both what is appIied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.

Certificate of AnaIysis

Notes

The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report.

Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in

advance.

AIl positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not

a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes, this method requirement has

not been performed.

SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating

Procedures.

J-vaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the

laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve

extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which

contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues.

(1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and

40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved

metaIs.

FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing.

Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrinaIomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due to rounding of anaIyte vaIues

occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue.

RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required for

matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of

anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 21701.

The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte.

(2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIoroisopropyl) ether.

UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the

inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe.

Notes

The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report.

Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in

advance.

AIl positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not

a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes, this method requirement has

not been performed.

SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating

Procedures.

J-vaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the

laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve

extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which

contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues.

(1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and

40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved

metaIs.

FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing.

Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrinaIomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due to rounding of anaIyte vaIues

occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue.

RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required for

matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of

anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 21701.

The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte.

(2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIoroisopropyl) ether.

UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the

inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe.

Notes

The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report.

Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in

advance.

AIl positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not

a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes, this method requirement has

not been performed.

SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating

Procedures.

J-vaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the

laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve

extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which

contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues.

(1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and

40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved

metaIs.

FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing.

Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrinaIomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due to rounding of anaIyte vaIues

occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue.

RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required for

matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of

anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 21701.

The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte.

(2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIoroisopropyl) ether.

UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the

inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe.

The resuits in this report appIy to the sampIes anaIyzed in

AGG2075 FINAL 07312023 1812

accordance with the chain of custody document. This

anaIytical report must be reproduced in its entirety.
