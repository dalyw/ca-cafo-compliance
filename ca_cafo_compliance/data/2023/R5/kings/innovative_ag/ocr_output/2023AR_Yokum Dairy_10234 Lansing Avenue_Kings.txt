FIELD NITROGEN RATIO Calculation:
“Field Nitrogen Ratio” = “Total Nitrogen Applied to Field” / “Total Nitrogen Extracted from Field at Harvest”

ATMOSHERIC DEPOSITION Applied (Ibs) Calculation:
“Nitroge! lied (Lbs)” = "14 Lbs (per year) * “Acres Planted”

HARVEST Nitrogen Extraction (Lbs) Calculation:

“Nitrogen Extracted (Lbs)” = ("Yield" (tons per acre) * 2000) * ((100 -"% Moisture") / 100 * "Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value" / 100) * "Acres Planted"
IRRIGATION Nitrogen and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

“Salts Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
PROCESS WASTEWATER Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

PI horus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

Potassium Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Potassium Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

Salt Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

SOLID MANURE (Corral, Separator, or Compost) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Phosphorus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Potassium Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Potassium Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Salt Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Ash Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”

“Lbs Applied per Acre” Calculations:
If “Application Units” = Tons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 2000
If “Application Units” = Acres Inches, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 *27,154.3
If “Application Units” = Acre Feet, Then Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 * 325,851
If “Application Units” = Gallons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount’ (per Acre) * 8.33

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD_; MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Explanation

406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Yokum/Double L Dairy FORM FOR
PRIORITY REPORTING OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
UNDER
WASTE DISCHARGE REQUIREMENTS GENERAL ORDER NO. R5-2013-0122

EXISTING MILK COW DAIRIES

A significant event is any noncompliance with Waste Discharge Requirements General Order No. R5-2010-0130 (General
Order) that endangers human health or the environment, or any noncompliance with Prohibitions A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A8, A9,
A10, A11, or A12 of the General Order. Discharge means the release of waste, such as solid manure or process wastewater,
to land, surface water, or groundwater. Most noncompliance will be from off- property discharge of solid manure or process

wastewater into surface water, or on-property discharge of solid manure or process wastewater in a way not allowed under the
General Order, such as the flooding of cropland with process wastewater.

Noncompliance does not have to include an off-property or improper on-property discharge of solid manure or process
wastewater, but can include actions that are not allowed under the General Order, such as accepting non-dairy waste for
disposal at a dairy.

A written report shall be submitted to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (Central Valley Water Board)
office within two weeks of the Discharger becoming aware of the significant event. The report shall contain a description of the
noncompliance, its causes, duration, and the actual or anticipated time for achieving compliance. The report shall include
complete details of the steps that the Discharger has taken or intends to take, in order to prevent recurrence. All intentional or
accidental spills shall be reported as required by this provision.

Properly completing the following form will satisfy the requirement for the written report.

Date and time the noncompliance started, and location of the
noncompliance (a map may be used to show the location) 4/13/2023

Was there a discharge of solid manure or process wastewater to
surface water as a result of the noncompliance? No

If the noncompliance included a discharge to surface water,

what was the ultimate destination of the discharge and the flow None
path of the discharge to the nearest water body? (a map may be

used to show the flow path)
