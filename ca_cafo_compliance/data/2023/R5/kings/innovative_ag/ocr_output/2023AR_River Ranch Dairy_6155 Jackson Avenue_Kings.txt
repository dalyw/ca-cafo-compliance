3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.

4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual
Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.

Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 : Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Explanation

406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.

DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.

Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.

L¢s : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.

MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.

MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Lcs : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based

on the LCS or CCV recovery.
