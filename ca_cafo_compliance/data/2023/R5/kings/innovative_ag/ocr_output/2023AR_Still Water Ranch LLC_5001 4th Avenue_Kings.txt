HARVEST Nitrogen Extraction (Lbs) Caiculation:
“Nitrogen Extracted (Lbs)” —-= ("Yield" (tons per acre) * 2000) * ((100 - "% Moisture") / 100 * "Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value" / 100) * "Acres Planted”
IRRIGATION Nitrogen and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:
“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

SOLID MANURE (Corral, Separator, or Compost) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQG : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 : Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

: Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.

Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.

Gs: : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.

MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.

MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD _: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
