Reporting period 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023.
ADDITIONAL NOTES
A. NOTES
1. As stated in the Annual Report, and required by the General Order, the dairies onsite Nutrient Management PIan has been updated and compIeted by a
certified agronomist. The dairy conducts its nutrient budgeting based on this certified pIan, and onIy uses the Annual Report as a compIimentary guide.
Submission of the nutrient budget in this annual report is done soIely to satisfy the requirements of the General Orders monitoring and reporting section.
2. AIl graphs in the annual report dispIay an amount of appIied and removed saIt. There are many ways inputs and exports of saIt can accounted for. The
Merced County website does not account for aIl of them. The graphs convey a partial / incompIete portrayal of saIts (depending on how saIts are defined,
measured, and evaIuated).
3. The General Order requires the submission of aIl land appIications in the caIendar year of the reporting period. This has been submitted. However, land
appIications that occur post harvest of the FaIl forage of the previous caIendar year are intended for the use of the Spring forage of the foIlowing caIendar year
(reporting period) as crop cycIes do not work on caIendar year dates. When such land appIications occur in the previous caIendar year, previous years anaIytical
data representing the appIications have been inputted to represent nutrients intended for the reporting periods Spring crop. As such, any land appIication that
occurs post harvest of the FaIl forage in the reporting period that is intended for the Spring forage of the foIlowing caIendar year wiIl not be inputted until the
foIlowing years Annual Report so that the Merced County reporting program software does not mistakenIy appIy these appIications to the incorrect crops as
there is no way to accurateIy differentiate and dispIay this situation in the Annual Report software .
4. AIl wastewater land appIications were summarized by quarter using the corresponding wastewater quarterIy sampIe to represent nutrient amounts appIied.
One appIication date per quarter per crop has been seIected to represent aIl appIications of wastewater for that crop during that quarter. The Annual Reports
nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper quarterIy sampIe has been seIected to represent nutrients appIied during that
specific quarter. Day specific records are kept on site and avaiIabIe upon request.
AIl fresh water land appIications during the report period have been summarized into one appIication per source per crop. One appIication date has been
seIected to represent the reporting period for that crop. The Annual Reports nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper
source sampIe has been seIected to represent nutrients appIied during the reporting period. Day specific records are kept on site and avaiIabIe upon request.
5. Due to high voIumes of avaiIabIe canal water, most, if not aIl weIls remained idIe during the growing season. Therefore littIe to no weIl sampIes exist. They wiIl
be sampIed again when operabIe.
