ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells |W #2, 4, & 8 were non-operational in 2023 and IW #11 is operational but was not used in 2023. All wells will be sampled once the wells become
operational and used during the cropping season. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for sufficient amounts of surface water to grow crops.

Field 4 Wheat & 70 Wheat had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to a lower than expected yield and %N. The %N was based on analysis that
was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold
of 1.4.

Field 70 Corn had a lower than anticipated removal rate due to lower than anticipated %N and low tonnage. This resulted in field ratios slightly exceeding target
limits.
