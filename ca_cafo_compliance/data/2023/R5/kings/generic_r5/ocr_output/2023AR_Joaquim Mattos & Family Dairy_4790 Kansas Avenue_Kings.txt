ASS OCIATES Certificate of AnaIysis

Notes
. The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report,
. Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in
advance.
 Ail positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not

a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes, this method requirement has

not been performed.

SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating

Procedures.

. J-vaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the

laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve j

extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which

contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues.

. (1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and f

40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved

metaIs.

. FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing.

. Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrinaIamethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due ta rounding of anaIyte vaIues
occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue.

. RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required far I
matrix interferences. i

. Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170-1. f

- The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte,

. (2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIorcisopropyl) ether.

UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the

inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe.

Notes
. The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report.
Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in
advance.
. AIl positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not
a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes. this method requirement has
not been performed.
. SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating
Procedures. .
. J-vaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve
extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which
contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues. L
. (1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved
metaIs. i
. FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing. i
. Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrihaIomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due to rounding of anaIyte vaIues
occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue. i
. RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required for i
matrix interferences. i
. Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of i
anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 21701.
- The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte. i
. (2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIoroisopropyl) ether.
UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe. H

Notes
 The Chain of Custody document and SampIe Integrity Sheet are part of the anaIytical report.
 Any remaining sampIe(s) for testing wiIl be disposed of according to BSKs sampIe retention poIicy unIess other arrangements are made in
advance.
- AIl positive resuIts for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the anaIysis of a FieId Reagent BIank (FRB) to confirm that the resuIts are not
a contamination error from fieId sampIing steps. If FieId Reagent BIanks were not submitted with the sampIes, this method requirement has
not been performed.
SampIes coIlected by BSK AnaIytical Laboratories were coIlected in accordance with the BSK SampIing and CoIlection Standard Operating
Procedures.
 JevaIue is equivaIent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace vaIue. A trace vaIue is an anaIyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This resuIt is of an unknown data quaIity and is onIy quaIitative (estimated). BaseIine noise, caIibration curve t
extrapoIation beIow the lowest caIibrator, method bIank detections, and integration artifacts can aIl produce apparent DNQ vaIues, which
contribute to the un-reIiabiIity of these vaIues.
. (1) - Residual chIorine and pH anaIysis have a 15 minute hoIding time for both drinking and waste water sampIes as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring weIl) sampIes must be fieId fiItered to meet the 15 minute hoIding time for dissoIved /
metaIs.
. FieId tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification avaiIabIe for fieId testing.
- Summations of anaIytes (i.e. Total TrihaIomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectIy, due to rounding of anaIyte vaIues i
occurring before or after the total vaIue is caIcuIated, as weIl as rounding of the total vaIue. i
. RL MuItipIier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sampIe preparation procedures and diIutions required for Hi
matrix interferences.
. Due to the subjective nature of the ThreshoId Odor Method, aIl characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
anaIysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 21701. L
. The MCLs provided in this report (if appIicabIe) represent the primary MCLs for that anaIyte.
. (2) - FormerIy known as Bis(2-ChIoroisopropyl) ether. .
UnIess otherwise noted, TOC resuIts by SM 5310C method do not incIude purgeabIe organic carbon, which is removed aIong with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negIigibIe .
