I. General Section

1. Reporting Period
This Annual Monitoring Report contains the required information for the period of January
01 through December 31. FieId data contains information pertaining to crop activities for
aIl crops harvested within this period. This aIlows for continuity of the winter crops.

2. Herd ProfiIe and Housing of the Dairy
The maximum and average number and type of animaIs, whether in open confinement or
housed under roof is provided in Attachment A.

3. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Generated
The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater generated for this period
is provided in Attachment A.

5. Ratio of Total Nitrogen AppIied to Removed for Land AppIication Areas

The ratio of total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied to land appIication areas and the
total nitrogen removed by crop harvest is provided in Attachment C.
AIso provided is the PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen (PAN) ratio which incIudes the inorganic
nitrogen and caIcuIates how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the
pIant through mineraIization for that crop. This incIudes both what is appIied during that
growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.

6. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Transferred
The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater transferred offsite for this
period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual transfers are documented in Attachment G.
Transfer documentation can be found in Item 13, Manure Tracking Manifests.

7. Land AppIication Areas Without Manure AppIications
The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did not receive
manure appIications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

8. Land AppIication Areas With Manure AppIications
The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did receive
manure appIications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

Notes
1. Generated totaIs are the sum of what was appIied to aIl land appIication areas and what was transferred to others. See Attachment E for
individual fieId appIications and Attachment G for individual transfers .
2. Dry tons are caIcuIated by
Dry Tons Tons As-Is (100-sampIe moisture ) / 100
3. SoIid manure nutrient pounds appIied are caIcuIated by
Total (N,P,K,SaIts) lbs - (Dry Tons)((N,P,K,Ash)/100)2,000
4. Process wastewater nutrient pounds appIied are caIcuIated by
Total (P,K,SaIts) lbs (GaIlons)(P,K, TDS mg/l)(8.337E-06)
Total (N) lbs (GaIlons)(NO3-NTKN mg/l)(8.337E-06)
5. AIl soIid manure appIied is considered as the organic form of nitrogen. Inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen in process wastewater are
caIcuIated by
Inorganic N lbs (GaIlons)(NO3-NNH4-N mg/I)(8.337E-06)
Organic N lbs (GaIlons)(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)(8.337E-06)
6. Estimated total saIt content in soIid manure is determined by fixed soIids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disoIved soIids. These are
not direct reIationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary wideIy in a sampIe if corral dirt becomes part of the sampIe.
AIso, ash content is onIy required to be anaIyzed once every two years. The latest resuItant vaIue is appIied to any subsequent appIications.

Notes
Total BaIance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied onIy during the time of that crops growing season.
PAN BaIance Ratio is based on PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen appIied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the pIant through
mineraIization. This incIudes both what is appIied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.
