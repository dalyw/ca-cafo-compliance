This report contains information required to be submitted as outIined by the Annual Reporting
section of the Revised Monitoring and Reporting Program No. R5-2013-0122 (pages MRP-12
through 14) for this dairy faciIity. This report is due by JuIy 01 foIlowing the reporting year.

l. General Section

1. Reporting Period

This Annual Monitoring Report contains the required information for the period of January
01 through December 31. FieId data contains information pertaining to crop activities for
aIl crops harvested within this period. This aIlows for continuity of the winter crops.

2. Herd ProfiIe and Housing of the Dairy

The maximum and average number and type of animaIs, whether in open confinement or
housed under roof is provided in Attachment A.

3. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Generated

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater generated for this period
is provided in Attachment A.

4. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients AppIied

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater appIied for this period is
provided in Attachment A.

Individual appIications to each fieId (Item 17, Record Keeping) is provided in Attachment
E.

5. Ratio of Total Nitrogen AppIied to Removed for Land AppIication Areas

The ratio of total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied to land appIication areas and the
total nitrogen removed by crop harvest is provided in Attachment C.

AIso provided is the PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen (PAN) ratio which incIudes the inorganic
nitrogen and caIcuIates how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the
pIant through mineraIization for that crop. This incIudes both what is appIied during that
growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.

6. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Transferred

The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater transferred offsite for this
period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual transfers are documented in Attachment G.
Transfer documentation can be found in Item 13, Manure Tracking Manifests.

7. Land AppIication Areas Without Manure AppIications

The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did not receive
manure appIications during the period is provided in Attachment B.

8. Land AppIication Areas With Manure AppIications

The total number of acres and APNs for aIl land appIication areas that did receive

Organic N lbs (GaIlons)(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)(8.337E-06)
6. Estimated total saIt content in soIid manure is determined by fixed soIids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disoIved soIids. These are
not direct reIationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary wideIy in a sampIe if corral dirt becomes part of the sampIe.
AIso, ash content is onIy required to be anaIyzed once every two years. The latest resuItant vaIue is appIied to any subsequent appIications.

Notes.

Total BaIance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) appIied onIy during the time of that crops growing season.

PAN BaIance Ratio is based on PIant AvaiIabIe Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen appIied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become avaiIabIe to the pIant through
mineraIization. This incIudes both what is appIied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous appIications to that fieId.

SampIing and Receipt Information AIl sampIes were received in acceptabIe condition and within
temperature requirements, unIess noted on the Condition Upon Receipt (CUR) form. AIl sampIes arrived
on ice. AIl sampIes were prepared and anaIyzed within the method specified hoId time. AIl sampIes were
checked for pH if acid or base preservation is required (except for VOAs). For detaiIs of sampIe receipt
information, pIease see the attached Chain of Custody and Condition Upon Receipt Form.

SampIing and Receipt Information

AIl sampIes were received in acceptabIe condition and within temperature requirements, unIess noted on the Condition
Upon Receipt (CUR) form. AIl sampIes were received, prepared and anaIyzed within the method specified hoIding times.
AIl sampIes arrived on ice. AIl sampIes were checked for pH if acid or base preservation is required (except for VOAs).
For detaiIs of sampIe receipt information, pIease see the associated Chain of Custody and Condition Upon Receipt Form.

QuaIity Control AIl sampIes were prepared and anaIyzed according to estabIished quaIity control criteria. Any exceptions are noted
in the QuaIity Control Section of this report.

Definition

BIank Method BIank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the sampIes.
DQO Data QuaIity Objective - This is the criteria against which the quaIity control data is compared.

Dup DupIicate SampIe - A random sampIe with each batch is prepared and anaIyzed in dupIicate. The reIative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and anaIysis.

LCs Laboratory Control Standard/SampIe - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting anaIyte recovery.

MS Matrix Spikes - A random sampIe is spiked with a known amount of anaIyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sampIe matrix
affects anaIyte recovery.

MSD Matrix Spike DupIicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sampIe dupIicate is spiked with a known amount of anaIyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sampIe matrix affects anaIyte recovery.

MSRPD_ MS/MSD ReIative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS reIative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

anaIysis.
A ND Non-detect - ResuIt was beIow the DQO listed for the anaIyte. a
