ADDITIONAL NOTES
A. NOTES
All data entered in this 2023 Annual Report is correct as submitted by the owner/operator and has been confirmed by the owner/operator to be accurate.
All fields returned acceptable total nitrogen ratios below the 1.65 total nitrogen ratio limit.
During the reporting period, the owner/operator made the decision to sell the milking herd. The herd was sold and the facility vacated by March 1, 2023. On
June 1, 2023 a lease agreement was started with an outside operator and the facility began operating as a heifer ranch. There are no milking cows on the
facility, however the facility will remain part of the Dairy General Order rather than move to the Bovine Order. This gives the owner/operator the option to resume
a milking herd in the future should the opportunity arise. The outside operator is utilizing the production areas only and the owner/operator retains use of all land
application areas. Per the lease agreement, the outside operator retains ownership of and exports all solid manure produced in the corrals whereas any liquid
manure produced and collected in the wastewater retention ponds is to be utilized by the owner/operator for agronomic purposes.
