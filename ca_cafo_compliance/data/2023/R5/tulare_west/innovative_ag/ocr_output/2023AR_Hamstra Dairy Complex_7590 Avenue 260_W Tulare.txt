Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is net contributing contamination to the samples,
DQO Data Quality Objective.- This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication-of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS of CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition.
Blank. Mathed Blank Prepared to verify that the preparation process i not-contrituliag contamination to the samples,
DQG Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality contral data is.compared.
Les r Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix. Spikes -A random sample is spiked with a known.amount of analyie. The racdveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD - i. Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RFD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation .
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
