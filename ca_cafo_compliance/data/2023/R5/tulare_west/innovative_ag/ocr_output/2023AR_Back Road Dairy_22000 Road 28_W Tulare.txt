DEO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Satiple -.A randam sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent differericeis an
indication. of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LES Laboratory Control Standard/Sampte - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrit Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveriesare an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD . Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with.a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSB Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
