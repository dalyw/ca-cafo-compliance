Season Notes The crop for this season was budgeted to a 1.4 nitrogen ratio using the historical 3-year average for the following yield, plant tissue nitrogen extraction, wastewater nitrogen content,

irrigation water, and manure nitrogen content. The nitrogen ratio for this crop is below .80 due to the variances between the budgeted and actual amounts.

Blak. Method Blank Prepared ta.verify that the preparation process is net coniibuting contaminationte the samples
BGO Data Quality Objective - This is the.criteria against which the quality control dats is compared.
Los s Laboratory Control Standard/Sample Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -.A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how thatsample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair -.A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD . MsiMsp Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis,
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition. -
Blank Method Blank- Prepared te verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the saniples.
s37eie) Date Quality Objective - This is the criteria ayainst which the quality control data t compared,
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery, .
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects. analyte recovery.
MSD. Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with.a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication-of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
