Definition ,
Blank. Method Blank Prepared to verify that the preparation process isnot conixibuting-contamination to the samples.
bQO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality contral data is compared.
Les Laboretory-Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -.A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are.an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries. are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples,
DRO - Data Quality Objective This is the criteria against which the. quality control data.is- compared.
LCs Labatatory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte ratovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -.A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD. Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD Mesh Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent. difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect -. Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
