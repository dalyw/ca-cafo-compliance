BQO . Date Quality Objective.- This is the criteria against which the.quality conteol dats is Compared.
Dup Diiplicate Sample -A random sample with each batch is prepared aud analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication-of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS. Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD . Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
