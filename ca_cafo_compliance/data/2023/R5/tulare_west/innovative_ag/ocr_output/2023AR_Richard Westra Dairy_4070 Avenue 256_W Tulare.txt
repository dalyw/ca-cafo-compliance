Definitton
Blank Method Blank Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DOG Data-Quality-Objective- This is the criteria against which the quality control-data.is compared.
Les Laboratory Contrel Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte Tecovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The racoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicateof MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND. Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition.
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination ta the samples.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percerit difference is an.
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCs Laboratory-Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process isnot affecting analyte recovery.
MS. y Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
lysis.
