Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is tot contributing contamination to the samples.
DEO Data Quality Ohjective - This is the. criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not. affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with.a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Mattix Spike-Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an.
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRED _ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis,
ND Non-detect. - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank _ Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to tha samples.
BQO Data Quality Objective - This.is the criteria against which the quality contral data is compared.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is nat contributing contamination to the samples.
Bea Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample .- A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify thatthe preparation process is not affacting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A randem.sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A raridom sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries.are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
