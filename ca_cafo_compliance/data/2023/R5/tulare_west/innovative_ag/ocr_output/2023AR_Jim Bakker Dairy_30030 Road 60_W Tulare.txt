Instructions
1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last for
several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.
2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.
3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each ranure-hauling event.
4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual
Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.
