Blank Method Blank - Prepared te verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DO. Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared,
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each baich is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DO. Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
. indication of precision for the preparation and analysis,
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
440 Sample nonhomogeneity may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank _ Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
BQO Data Qualtty Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MsivsD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation processis not.contributing contamination to the samples.
BQO _s Data Quellity Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
LGs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -.A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are-an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate ef MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD Ma/MED Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
lysis.
ND Non-detect- Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based

Definition.
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
perele) Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is tet contributing contamination to thesamples.
BRO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control date-is compared,
Dup Duplicate Saniple - A random sample with each hatch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate, The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation.and analysis.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process.is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how-that sample matrix
affects. analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
lysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample, Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples,
Dod Data-Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data-is compared.
Dop Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and. analyzed.in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detact - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample, Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
