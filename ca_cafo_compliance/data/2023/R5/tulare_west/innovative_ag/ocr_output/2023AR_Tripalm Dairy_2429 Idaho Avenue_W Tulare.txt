Mr. Scott Hatton

Fresno, CA 93706
Re Request for Annual Fee Reduction
Dear Mr. Hatton,
We are writing to request a reduction of fees for Tri Palm Dairy, located at 2429 Idaho Avenue,
Hanford, CA. As of July 1, 2023, Tri Palm Dairy no longer has mature cows on site and has ceased
its operations as a milking facility. The dairy is currently in the process of closing its permits with the
Dairy General Order. Therefore, we respectfully ask that the RWQCB adjust the annual fees to
reflect the facilitys current status.
Please contact Innovative Ag Services with any questions regarding this response.
Sincerely,
Mike Kalmink
Ce Richard Westra

or TKN, P, K, TDS) x 10-6 using the samples closest in date to the export event.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQG Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MesD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis,
ND Non-detect - Result was helow the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 Sample matrix may he affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
