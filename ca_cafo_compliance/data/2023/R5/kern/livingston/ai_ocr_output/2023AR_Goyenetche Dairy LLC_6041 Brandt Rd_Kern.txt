Notes

Without allowance for the significant amount of rainfall during the winter months of 2022/2023, the irrigation logs on each field page of the annual report, reflect canal and/or well used only during that time frame. The facility did not irrigate during the "Significant Storm Events".

It is inaccurate to present "salt" application without acknowledging that there is substantial uptake and utilization of "salts" by crops. If it is possible to calculate "salt" application, it is also possible to calculate "salt" utilization. That calculation should be included in this report. To calculate "salt" utilization is a lengthy process and cannot be done with the constituents required in the Revised General Order sampling requirements.

The signature(s) affixed to this report does not affirmatively refer to those references to "salt" that we know to be incorrect.

Definition  
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.  
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.  
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.  
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSRPD : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Sampling and Receipt Information:  
All samples were received in acceptable condition and within temperature requirements, unless noted on the Condition Upon Receipt (CUR) form. All samples were received, prepared and analyzed within the method specified holding times. All samples arrived on ice. All samples were checked for pH if acid or base preservation is required (except for VOAs). For details of sample receipt information, please see the associated Chain of Custody and Condition Upon Receipt Form.  
Quality Control: All samples were prepared and analyzed according to established quality control criteria. Any exceptions are noted in the Quality Control Section of this report.

Definition  
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.  
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.  
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.  
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSRPD : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Definition  
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.  
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.  
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.  
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.  
MSRPD : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.  
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Enclosed is the 2023/2024 Nutrient Budget for your facility to comply with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board General Order No. R5-2007-0035.

*2023 Whole Farm Nitrogen Balance

The whole farm nitrogen balance for the crop year 2022 was 0.90  
Nitrogen Summary will show the balances for each field and for the whole farm.

*Ranges for the Whole Farm Nitrogen Balance

| Factor | Status | Evaluation |  
|---|---|---|   
| > 1.65 | Excessive | Too much nitrogen applied |  
| 1.4 - 1.65 | Slightly High | Nitrogen is satisfactory to slightly high |  
| 0.9 - 1.4 | Normal | Normal to slightly low |  
| < 0.9 | Low | Low nitrogen status, additional nitrogen needed |

*Nutrient Management Plan/ Nutrient Budget Certification

This Nutrient Budget was prepared by a Certified Crop Advisor as required by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.
