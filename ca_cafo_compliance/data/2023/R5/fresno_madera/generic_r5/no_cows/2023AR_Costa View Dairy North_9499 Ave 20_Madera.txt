ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells #3, 4, 6, & 7 were non-operational in 2023. All wells will be sampled once the wells become operational and/or used during the cropping season.
Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a greater amount of surface water allocation to grow crops.

Fields 13 Almonds & 14&15 Almonds had lower than anticipated removal rates due to lower than anticipated %N or low tonnage. This resulted in a field ratio
that slightly exceeded the target limit.

Fields 3&4 Corn, 6A Corn, 6B Corn, 9 Corn had higher than anticipated removal rates. This was due to higher than expected %N and/or yield. The %N
removed, which is based on analysis derived through a certified laboratory, exceeded the anticipated values for this crop. Appropriate management practices
resulted in decent yields and/or higher than expected nutrient removal rates.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields 1 & 2 Almonds received no wastewater or solid manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to Almond fields were contributed through freshwater applications
and commercial fertilizer only.
