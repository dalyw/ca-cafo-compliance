o Nutrient applications shown in Attachment B are on a crop year basis.

« Lab sample data results for applications are based on the sample taken closest to the application date. Lab sample data results are shown on 100% dry basis for manure applications
and harvest events.

o Well Avg: Irrigation source representing the average nutrient values of all irrigation wells sampled for the facility during the reporting year.

** Book Value: No sample data results were available. For manure applications and plant tissue harvests, the calculations were based off book values.

FIELD NITROGEN RATIO Calculation:

“Field Nitrogen Ratio” = “Total Nitrogen Applied to Field” / “Total Nitrogen Extracted from Field at Harvest”

ATMOSHERIC DEPOSITION Applied (Ibs) Calculation:
“Ni ied (Lbs)” = “14 Lbs (per year) * “Acres Planted”

HARVEST Nitrogen Extraction (Lbs) Calculation:

“Nitrogen Extracted (Lbs)” = ("Yield" (tons per acre) * 2000) * ((100 - "% Moisture") / 100 * "Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value" / 100) * "Acres Planted”
IRRIGATION Nitrogen and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:
“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
“Salts Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
PROCESS WASTEWATER Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Phosphorus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Potassium Lis bs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Potassium Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Salt Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
SOLID MANURE (Corral, Separator, or Compost) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:
Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value’/100) * “Acres Planted”
Phosphorus Applie = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Potassium Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Potassium Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Salt Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Ash Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”

“Lbs Applied per Acre” Calculations:
If “Application Units” = Tons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 2000
If “Application Units” = Acres Inches, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 *27,154.3
If “Application Units” = Acre Feet, Then Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 * 325,851
If “Application Units” = Gallons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount’ (per Acre) * 8.33

Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifest

Instructions:

1. Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last
for several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2. Ifthere are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

3. The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling
event.

4. The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the
Annual Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.
