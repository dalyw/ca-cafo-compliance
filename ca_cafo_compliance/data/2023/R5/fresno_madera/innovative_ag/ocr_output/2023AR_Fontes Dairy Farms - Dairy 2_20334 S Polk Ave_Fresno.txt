FIELD NITROGEN RATIO Calculation:
“Field Nitrogen Ratio” = “Total Nitrogen Applied to Field” / “Total Nitrogen Extracted from Field at Harvest”

ATMOSHERIC DEPOSITION Applied (Ibs) Calculation:
“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = "14 Lbs (per year) * “Acres Planted”

HARVEST Nitrogen Extraction (Lbs) Calculation:
“Ni ” = ("Yield" (tons per acre) * 2000) * ((100 - "% Moisture") / 100 * "Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value" / 100) * "Acres Planted"

IRRIGATION Nitrogen and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
“Salts Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
PROCESS WASTEWATER Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:
Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Ph lied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Potassium Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Potassium Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Salt Applied (Lbs)" = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
SOLID MANURE (Corral, Separator, or Compost) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:
Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value’/100) * “Acres Planted”
Phosphorus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value’/100) * “Acres Planted”

Applied " = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Ash Value"/100) * “Acres Planted”

“Lbs Applied per Acre” Calculations:
If “Application Units” = Tons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 2000
If “Application Units” = Acres Inches, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 *27,154.3
If “Application Units” = Acre Feet, Then Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 * 325,851
If “Application Units” = Gallons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount’ (per Acre) * 8.33

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Les : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based

on the LCS or CCV recovery.

435 : Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
