is Your Compost Stable7
Respiration Rate
64 Moderate-selected use mg CO2-Cig OMiday
The respiration rate is a measurement of the biodegradation rate of the organic matter in the sample (as received).
The respiration rate is determined by measuring the rate at which CO2 is released under optimized moisture and
temperature conditions.
is Your Compost Mature7
AmmoniaNNitrateN ratio Composting to stabilize carbon can occur at such a rapid rate that sometimes phytotoxins remain in
29 immature the compost and must be neutralized before using in high concentrations or in high-end uses. This
Ammonia N ppm step is called curing. Typically ammonia is in excess with the break-down of organic materials resulting
1600 immature in an increase in pH. This combination results in a loss of volatile ammonia (it smells). Once this toxic
Nitrate N ppm ammonia has been reduced and the pH drops, the microbes convert the ammonia to nitrates. A low
55 mature ammonia high nitrate score is indicative of a mature compost, however there are many exceptions.
For example, a compost with a low pH (7) will retain ammonia, while a compost with high lime content
can lose ammonia before the organic fraction becomes stable. Composts must first be stable before
curing indicators apply.
Cucumber Bioassay
0.0 Percent Cucumbers are chosen for this test because they are salt tolerant and very sensitive to ammonia
and organic acid toxicity. Therefore, we can germinate seeds in high concentrations of compost to
measure phytotoxic effects without soluble salts being the limiting factor. Vatues above 80 for both percent emergence and
vigor are indicative of a well-cured compost. Exceptions include very high salts that affect the cucumbers, excessive concentrations
of nitrates and other nutrients that will be in range when formulated to make a growing media.
Js Your Compost Safe Regarding Health7
Fecal Coliform
 1000 ig dry wt. Fecal coliforms can survive in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and is commen in all initial
compost piles. Most human pathogens occur from fecal matter and all fecal matter is loaded in fecal coliforms. Therefore fecal
coliforms are used as an indicator to determine if the chosen method for pathogen reduction (heat for compost) has met the
requirements of sufficient temperature, time and mixing. If the fecal coliforms are reduced to below 1000 per gram dry wt. it is
assumed all others pathogens are eliminated. Potential problems are that fecal coliform can regrow during the curing phase or
during shipping. This is because the conditions are now more favorable for growth than during the composting process.
Salmonella Bacteria
Less than3 3/4gdrywt. Salmonella is not only another indicator organism but also a toxic microbe. It has been used in the
case of biosolids industry to determine adequate pathogen reduction.
Motals
Pass The ten heavy metals listed in the EPA 503 regulations are chosen to determine if compost
can be applied to ag land and handled without toxic effects. Most high concentrations of heavy metals are derived from
woodwaste feedstock such as chrome-arsenic treated or lead painted demolition wood. Biosolids are rarely a probtem.
Does Your Compost Provide Nutrients or Organic Matter7
Nutrients (NP205K20)
7.8 High nutrient content
This vaiue is the sum of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Reported units are consistent with those
found on fertilizer formulations. A sum greater than 5 is indicative of a compost with high nutrient content, and best used to supply
nutrients to a receiving soil. A sum below 2 indicates low nutrient content, and is best-used to improve soil structure via the
addition of organic matter. Most compost falls between 2 and 5.

Agindex (Nutrients/NatCl)

2 Low nutrient ratio Composts with low Agindex values have high concentrations of sodium and/or chtoride
compared to nutrients, Repeated use of a compost with a low Agindex ( 2) may result in sodium and/or chloride
acting as the limiting facter compared to nutrients, governing application rates. These composts may be used on well-draining
soils and/or with salt-tolerant plants. Additional nutrients form another source may be needed if the apptication rate is limited by
sodium or chloride. If the Agindex is above 10, nutrients optimal for plant growth will be available without concern of sodium and/or
chloride toxicity. Composts with an Agindex of above 10 are good for increasing nutrient levels for all soils. Most composts score
between 2 and 10, Concentrations of nutrients, sodium, and chloride in the receiving soil shoutd be considered when determining
compost application rates. The Agindex is a product of feedstock quality. Feedstock from dairy manure, marine waste, industrial
wastes, and halophytic plants are likely to produce a finished compost with a low Agindex.

Plant Avaitable Nitrogen (Ibs/ton)

10 Average N Provider Plant Available Nitrogen (PAN) is catculated by estimating the release rate of Nitrogen from
the organic fraction of the compost. This estimate is based on the respiration rate, ammonia, and nitrate values. Despite the PAN
value of the compost, additional sources of Nitrogen may be needed during he growing season to offset the Nitrogen demand
of the microbes present in the compost. With ample nutrients these microbes can further breakdown organic matter in the
compost and release bound Nitregen. Nitrogen demand based on a high C/N ratio is not considered in the PAN catculation
because additional Nitrogen should always be supplemented to the receiving soil when composts with a high C/N ratio are applied.
CIN Ratio

13 Indicates maturity As a guiding principal, a C/N ratio below 14 indicates maturity and above 14 indicates
immaturity, however, there are many exceptions. Large woodchips (6.3mm), bark, and redwood are slow to breakdown and
therefore can result in a relatively stable product while the C/N ratio value is high. Additionally, some composts with chicken manure
and/or green grass feedstocks can start with a C/N ratio below 15 and are very unstable. A C/N ratio below 10 supplies Nitrogen,
while a ratio above 20 can deplete Nitrogen from the soil. The rate at which Nitrogen will be released or used by the microbes is
indicated by the respiration rate. If the respiration rate is too high the transfer of Nitrogen will not be controlable.

Soluble Nutrients & Salts (ECS wiw dw - mmhos/cm)

22 High salts This value refers to all soluble ions including nutrients, sodium, chloride and some
soluble organic compounds. The concentration of salts will change due to the release of salts from the organic matter as it degrades,
volatitization of ammonia, decomposition of soluble organics, and conversion of molecular structure. High salts high Agindex is
indicative of a compost high in readily available nutrients. The application rate of these composts should be limited by the optimum
nutrient value based on soil analysis of the receiving soil. High Salts low Agindex is indicative of a compost tow in nutrients with
high concentrations of sodium and/or chloride. Limit the application rate according to the toxicity level of thesodium and/or chloride.
Low salts indicates that the compost can be applied without risking salt toxicity, is likely a good source of organic matter, and that
nutrients will release slowly over time.

Lime Content (Ibs. per ton)

93 High lime content Compost high in lime or carbonates are often those produced from chicken manure (layers)
ash materials, and lime products. These are excellent products to use on a receiving soil where lime has been recommended by
soil analysis to raise the pH. Composts with a high time content should be closely considered for pH requirements when formulating
potting mixes.

Physical Properties
Percent Ash

36.5 Average ash content Ash is the non-organic fraction of a compost. Most composts contain approximately 50
ash (dry weight basis). Compost can be high in ash content for many reasons including excess minerilzation(old compost),
contamination with soil base material during turning, poor quality feedstock, and soil or mineral products added. Finding the source
and reducing high ash content is often the fastest means to increasing nutrient quality of a compost.

Particle Size 6.3 MM (0.25)

48.1 May restrict use Large particles may restrict use for potting soils, golf course topdressings, seed-starter
mixes, and where a fine size distribution is required. Composts with large particles can still be used as excellent additions to field
soils, shrub mixes and mulches.
