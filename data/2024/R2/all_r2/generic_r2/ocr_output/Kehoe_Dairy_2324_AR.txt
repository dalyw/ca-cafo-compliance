v Check the box that applies X Group Monitoring Program U Individual Monitoring Plan

If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during

or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
events shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined
facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.) Documents

Both participants of a Group Monitoring Program and facilities with an Individual Monitoring Plan, fill
out the section below
Did any surface water samples exceed General Order benchmarks Yes Xx No
If yes, identify the results of the additional samples conducted to isolate the problem, and describe
the findings. Include a detailed description of the identified pollutant source and corrective actions
taken (attach additional pages if necessary).
Groundwater Sampling
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box below that applies.

2023 Residual Dry Matter (RDM) Monitoring Report
J Ranch and portion of K Ranch (Allotment 15)
Point Reyes National Seashore
In 2023, visual mapping revealed approximately 91 of surveyed areas on Allotment 15 (J and K Ranch)
to be at or above the 1200 pound per acre RDM standard. The remaining 9 of Allotment 15 that was
below this value included feeding and corral areas where cattle regularly congregate, and hillsides with
steeper slopes and rockier soils. Silage fields were also visually mapped but are not included in the
percentages above as they are actively harvested and planted each year. Management adjustments
were observed on the K Ranch portion of the operation this year, marking substantial improvement in
RDM as compared to 2022. Improvements were also observed in the feeding area north of Kehoe Beach
Trail. Transect 14 in the Tomales Bay pasture had the highest RDM level recorded across all ranches this
year (5800 Ibs/acre). Careful management of rotations, stocking rates and supplemental feeding is
necessary to ensure improved RDM conditions continue in 2024, with attention to areas where RDM
less than 1200 pounds per acre was observed this year.

Water Year (Oct 1 - Sep 30)
Figure 10 Percentage of water year rainfall from 1987-2023 compared to long-term running average
based on data from Point Reyes National Seashore Bear Valley (Olema OVYC1) weather station. The
rainfall data is a sum of daily rainfall for each water year October 1-September 30. Two additional local
weather stations, BBEC1 (located on Mt. Barnabe), or Point Reyes Station (Marin County OneRain
38029) were used to fill in any data gaps.

Figure 11 Visual field estimates of RDM on Allotment 15 in 2023. Of the visually mapped area, 91 was 1200 Ibs/acre
and 9 was 1200 Ibs/acre. In general, only grassland vegetation types were mapped during the survey. Fields where
active forage production occurs for silage are indicated with crosshatching.

2024 RDM transect results in pounds per acre were 6,090 for T14, 3,607 forT15, 2,703 for
T25, and 1,743 for T47. These are well above the 1,200 pounds per acre park standard. The
majority of the ranch was visually mapped as above 1,800 pounds per acre.
It looks like we only have water quality results for 2 storm samples this year. All of these
values are within the Regional Water Quality Control Board benchmarks.
