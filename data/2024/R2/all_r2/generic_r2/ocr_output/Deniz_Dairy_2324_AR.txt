E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Piease refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling

and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling
Yv Check the box that applies. Group Monitoring Program 0 Individual Monitoring Plan

lf you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shail take place during

or direstly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
events sfiall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any lab report Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined
facilities and landNapplication areas.

2. Describe your sampltyg methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.)

Groundwater Sampling
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box below that applies
