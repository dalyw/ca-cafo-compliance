The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporbng Program (General WORs, Attachment A). Please reler to Attachment 4, Section C, for sampling

and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling. VA
 Check the box that applies. V Group Monitenng Program 7 Individual Menitering Pian

Lf you are not dentitied as participabng ina Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surlace water sampling as required in the General Permit, Adachment A. Sampling shall take place dunng

or directly fatlowing aach of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
events shall be al least 14 days apart.

1. Prowde surface water sampling results in the table below of alfach similar documentation, including
any lab reports. Also allach a map of the sampling locations, sncluding the proximity of the confined
facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (helt equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc. ).

Groundwater Sampling
All facilies with manure storage ponds musl conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
2 group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells jocated wilhin the confined facility, including /
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shail be sampled 4 tines botal, appronimataty 6 months apart. .
Results of groundwater samples collected consislecdly with the sanipling protocols and within hese time i
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County mak inspector) may be
Submitted fo the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative i
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyZed by 4 laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services of a laboratory pre-approved by Ihe Water Board staff. ,
Check the box below that applies-
