Both participants of a Group Monitoring Program and facilities with an Individual Monitoring Plan, fill out the section below:

Did any surface water samples exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☑ No

If yes, identify the results of the additional samples conducted to isolate the problem, and describe the findings. Include a detailed description of the identified pollutant source and corrective actions taken (attach additional pages if necessary).

Groundwater Sampling:

All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart. Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).

Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.

Check the box below that applies: ☐ Reporting groundwater sampling results this year.

☑ In Table 2, list the samples that have been collected to date. ☑

V In Table 3, report your results.

v Attach the lab reports for each sample reported in Table 3. ☑

Groundwater sampling requirement has been met. ☑

In Table 2, list the 4 consecutive sampling periods and move on to Section F. ☑

☐ The facility has no domestic or agricultural supply wells representative of its waste retention ponds: ☑ If checked, move on to Section F.

Note: If all sampling events have not been completed during the required time periods, future sampling is required until all wells have been sampled a total of 4 times consecutively, approximately 6 months apart.

If reporting groundwater samples this year, fill out the section below:

Did any groundwater samples from this year exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☐ No Have any wells had multiple samples exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A

If yes to both, additional sampling may be necessary to confirm the result, and Water Board Staff will follow up within 30 days of the Annual Report deadline to investigate the concern. In the area below, describe any additional information you may have about the contaminated well (attach additional pages if necessary).

F. Summary

☑ Yes ☐ No Have all the required monitoring and inspections been completed? ☑ Yes ☐ No Have certifications for all required reports been submitted to the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board? ☑ Yes ☐ No Based on your visual inspections and water quality monitoring results, did your facility operate in compliance with the General Permit?

If no, explain:

Certification

"I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this report and all attachments and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the information is true, accurate, and complete.
