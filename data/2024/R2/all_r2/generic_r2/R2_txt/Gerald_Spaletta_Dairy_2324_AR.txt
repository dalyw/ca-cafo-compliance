The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compliance updates, demonstrate that the facility is ready for the rainy season, document required water quality monitoring and actions taken to correct identified problems, and to demonstrate that each facility is operating in compliance with the requirements of Order No. R2-2016-0031 (General Permit).

Any discharges of waste, wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human health or the environment, must be verbally reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board Spill Hotline at (510) 622-2369 and to the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) at (800) 852-7550. Within 14 business days, a written report describing the incident and resulting corrective actions must be submitted, as indicated below.

By November 30 of each year, please complete this form to document compliance and submit it to:

E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling:

v Check the box that applies: ☑

☑ Group Monitoring Program ☐ Individual Monitoring Plan If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.):

Note: If all sampling events have not been completed during the required time periods, future sampling is required until all of 1 times consecutively, approximately 6 months apart.

If reporting groundwater samples this year, fill out the section below:

Did any groundwater samples from this year exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ No ☐ Yes ☐ No Have any wells had multiple samples exceed General Order benchmarks? ☐ Yes ☐ N/A

If yes to both, additional sampling may be necessary to confirm the result, and Water Board Staff will follow up within 30 days of the Annual Report deadline to investigate the concern. In the area below, describe any additional information you may have about the contaminated well (attach additional pages if necessary).

F. Summary

☑ Yes ☐ No Have all the required monitoring and inspections been completed? ☑ Yes ☐ No Have certifications for all required reports been submitted to the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board? ☑ Yes ☐ No Based on your visual inspections and water quality monitoring results, did your facility operate in compliance with the General Permit?

If no, explain:
