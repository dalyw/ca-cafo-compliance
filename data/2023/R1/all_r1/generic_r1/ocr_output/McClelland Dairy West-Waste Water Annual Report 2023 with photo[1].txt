A Manure Manifest form is required to be fiIled out and kept on the FaciIity if manure is hauIed off the FaciIity. This is to

quaIity. CompIeted forms must be avaiIabIe to Regional Water Board staff during inspections and upon staff request. Has

E. Photo Documentation per Monitoring and Reporting PIan

PIease attach photo documentation of compIiance with required preseason poIlution prevention

measures.

Photos of newIy impIemented poIlution prevention measures to protect surface and groundwater

shail be submitted. ExampIes of poIlution prevention incIudes cIeaning of manure ponds, storm

water separation from manured areas, scraping of manured areas, covering manure piIes,

compost, and feed storage areas, impermeabIe ground covering in these storage areas to prevent

groundwater contamination, stream zone protection, and any other best management practices or

control measures for water quaIity protection.

AnnuaIly, pIease incIude dated photos of the watercourse assessment (Monitoring and Reporting

Program, Section I, Item A.7). This incIudes photos of riparian vegetation, streambanks,

watercourse crossings, and any potential erosion that couId discharge to watercourses. Photos

are to show current water quaIity protection and any projects that are in progress to improve water

quaIity. Page 6 of this Annual Report has space to expIain improvement projects.

The objective of the Annual Report is to demonstrate that the FaciIity is ready for the wet season

and wiIl not discharge sediment and nutrients to surface waters or groundwater.

Photo Documentation of Preseason Best Management Practices is Attached a Yes

F. Water QuaIity SampIing
The information beIow summarizes the water quaIity sampIing requirements, as presented in the Monitoring and
Reporting Program (MRP).
Surface Water SampIing
Surface watercourses that fIow through the FaciIity, incIuding the production area, cropIand, or pastures, must be
sampIed using grab sampIes at the point where watercourses enter and leave the property. AIternativeIy, if surface
waters fIow adjacent to the property but not through the property, and are located such that they couId be impacted by
activities at the FaciIity, the grab sampIes shaIl be coIlected upstream and downstream of the areas cIosest to the
FaciIity. SampIing shaIl take pIace during or directIy foIlowing each of three (3) major storm events, of one (1) inch or
more per 24-hours, during the rainy season, beginning in the winter season of 2016-2017. Three (3) measurements
of eIectrical conductivity taken three (3) minutes apart shaIl be recorded during each sampIing event at each location.
Total ammonia nitrogen, pH, and temperature shaIl be coIlected once at each sampIing location for each sampIing
event during or foIlowing storm events described in this section above. The MRP requires recording of visual
observations, such as changes in stream coIor or turbidity at the time of sampIing. PIease incIude those observations
beIow or in an attachment.

G. Best Management Practices
(In this section pIease describe the current condition and effectiveness of management measures not
previousIy described eIsewhere in this Annual Report. PIease attach additional sheets if more space is
needed to fuIly answer these topics).
Manure Ponds Are the liners of the manure ponds currentIy protective of water quaIity (free of weeds, animal
burrows, and cracks that may disturb the liner)2 PIease describe NO Chavges tr wOp
Do the manure ponds have sufficient storage capacity prior to the upcoming rainy season as required in the
Order2 Describe the method used to make this determination Nes mo Monge tp Lee
PIease describe aIl new measures taken to prevent nuisances at the manure ponds. Nuisances incIude odors,
breeding mosquitoes, damage from burrowing animaIs, damage from equipment during removal of soIids,
embankment settIing, erosion seepage, excess weeds, aIgae, and other vegetation that couId compromise the
needed capacity or proper functioning of your faciIity and/or degrade water quaIity No Cha Noes

Annual iMsperpety week Remoy AL
Riparian Protection Are effective stream protections present in aIl pastures that prevent animal waste and
sediment from entering waterways (exampIe- bridges, cuIverts, rocked crossings, fencing out animaIs, water
troughs away from streams, shade away from streams, extensive vegetation, revegetation of bare areas, etc.)
YesQ/NoO NAQ
Describe current water quaIity issues on the FaciIity such as at stream crossings and riparian areas (exampIe- stream
bank trampIing and compaction, soil erosion, lack of ground cover and riparian shade protection, and discharge of
fecal matter, sediment, and nutrients). NO GieRernst sees

H. CEQA Mitigation Measures
The Order states that Areas specified in Confidential Appendix D of the CEQA document shail be surrounded with
permanent fencing and rotationaIly grazed when soil conditions are dry. Dairy cattIe within this permanent fencing

The Order states that AIso, the dirt road that bisects the area specified in Confidential Appendix D wiIl be used onIy
when dry. If visibIe erosion of the road surface or adjacent area occurs, then the use wiIl be haIted immediateIy until
the road surface is restored, or is reseeded so that a thick growth of pasture grasses is estabIished, or is covered with
