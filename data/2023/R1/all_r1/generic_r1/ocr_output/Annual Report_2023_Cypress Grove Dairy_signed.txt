H. Best Management Practices

In this section, pIease describe the condition and effectiveness of management measures not

previousIy described eIsewhere in this Annual Report. PIease attach additional sheets if more

space is needed to fuIly answer these topics.

4. Erosion Control PIease describe aIl other measures not previousIy described, that prevent
and minimize the occurrence of erosion and discharge of manure, feed, waste, and soil
particIes from the dairy to surface water or groundwaters.

BMPs incIude stockpiIe management, preservation of existing vegetation, good housekeeping,
use of barn downspouts, bark beds, bioswaIe, spiIl pIanning afd prevention, road erosion control,

2. Nuisance Control PIease describe aIl measures taken to prevent nuisances. IncIude
odors, breeding mosquitoes, damage from burrowing animaIs, damage from equipment
during removal of soIids, embankment settIing, erosion seepage, excess weeds, aIgae,
and other vegetation that couId compromise the needed capacity or proper functioning of
your faciIity and/or degrade water quaIity.

Pest control (predatory wasps) is used at the dairy to minimize fIies. Odor control is managed
wtih good housekeeping. There is a vegetative barrier surrounding the property, and location of
manure storage shed is away from the neighbors.

3. Groundwater Protection Describe measures taken to protect groundwater from
contamination at weIlheads, sinkhoIes, and tiIe drains.

The central weIl was instaIled in 2012 to county standards and is located approx. 585 feet away
from any manure Storage. The domestic weIl is located 100 feet away from animaIs and over 700
feet away from manure storage.

4. Is manure and nutrient appIication to pastures or cropIands performed at rates which are
reasonabIe for the crop, soil, cIimate, special local situations, management system, and
type of manure2

JuIy 15, 2021. Nutrient appIication to pastures was discontinued when the bark beds were
instaIled.
6. How are faIl and winter nutrient appIication prevented from entering surface waters or
percoIating to groundwater2
ExampIe IncIude distance appIied from creeks and drainages, avoidance of standing water
such as in wetIands, appIication during dry weather, appIication to vegetated areas, etc.
Not appIicabIe. There wiIl be no faIl and winter nutrient appIication.
7. Are the liners of the manure ponds protective of water quaIity (free of weeds, animal
burrows, and cracks that may disturb the liner) PIease describe-

8. Do the manure ponds have sufficient storage capacity prior to the rainy season as
required in the GWDR Describe the method used to make this determination
Yes, the required storage capactiy has been caIcuIated and confirmed in the Nutrient
Management PIan.
9. PIease describe the measures taken to avoid surface runoff of manure constituents from
the dairys land appIication areas
Liquid manure was not land appIied near any surface waters. Land appIication has been
discontinued since mid JuIy 2021 after the bark bed was cIeaned out. There is no access to
surface waters from the dairy property.
10. Describe the measures taken to separate or divert stormwater from contacting manured
areas, corraIs, pens, and animal housing areas
BMPs are used to divert stormwater. Manure storage areas and housing areas are covered and
have impermeabIe concrete fIooring. Run off is diverted using gutters and run off channeIed
away from the areas.
11.Describe the measures taken to minimize infiItration of manure-laden water into
underIying soiIs within manured areas, corraIs, pens, and animal housing areas
BMPs are used to prevent manure-laden water (refer to question 10). In addition, lots are
winterized and areas where water couId pool are fiIled in.
