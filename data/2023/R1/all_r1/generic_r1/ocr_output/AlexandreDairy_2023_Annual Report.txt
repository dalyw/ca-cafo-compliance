Has a Nutrient Management PIan (NMP per MRP-Appendix 2) been prepared
or revised for the dairy Yes X No(_
If yes, what is the year the NMP is or wiIl be finaIized and who compIeted the NMP
Year of NMP 2018
Technical Service Provider/Approving Agency-
NRCS/SHN (Cindy WiIcox)
Number of acres of pasture 2,754
Number of acres of other crops and crop type 4ll Pasture
For faciIities with a prepared Nutrient Management PIan (NMP)
How has the dairy NMP been impIemented within the past year2
As outIined in the Water QuaIity PIan submitted 6/15/2021, nutrients have been appIied at agronomic
rates throughout the year and foIlowed CNMP principaIs to to evenIy disperse throughout Dairy
pastures.
Describe pasture or crop rotation practices and other management practices impIemented
during the past year to ensure nutrients appIied to pasture or cropIands were appIied at
agronomic rates. Provide the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) budget caIcuIations for each
appIicabIe fieId/crop type for the past year to demonstrate whether nutrients appIied were at
agronomic rates. If sampIing of manure, process water, soil, and/or pIant tissue was compIeted
in the past year, pIease demonstrate how these resuIts were utiIized in the nutrient budget
caIcuIations
We tract appIications, track irrigation and monitor yieIds based on tons manuaIly harvested. We are
however waiting outcomes of research being conducted for a more formal means of answering this
question. Of course we are pasture based and success reIies on forage production on the ranch.
We are aIso organic.
Is the dairy in compIiance with NMP requirements for manure, soil, and
pIant tissue sampIing2 Yes (X No L)
If so, provide the nutrient budget caIcuIations to demonstrate that the dairy is appIying nutrients
at agronomic rates
Soil sampIes are taken, however we wiIl conduct additional sampIing at the concIusion of research
being conducted to heIp answer this question for the State. There is no new news currentIy about
this study.
PIease add any comments regarding soil sampIing resuIts such as pIans to adjust nutrient
appIication rates at specific locations to meet agronomic rates.
Soil organic matter content is extremeIy important to the productivity of the farm. As the onIy pasture
based RegenerativeIy certified dairy in the Country, were we focus on farming and grazing practices
that, among other benefits, reverse cIimate change by rebuiIding soil organic matter and restoring
degraded soil biodiversity - resuIting in both carbon draw-down and improving water quaIity.

L. Water Conservation
The GWDR encourages water conservation. The Water QuaIity PIan, section J, discusses the
importance of water conservation. PIease describe the water conservation measures practiced
within the past year on the dairy incIuding pastures and cropIand that heIp to conserve water.
(ExampIes vegetate bare soil areas, use water efficientIy, repair leaks in a timeIy manner,
utiIize rain gutters on buiIdings and discharge the cIean stormwater to vegetated areas, infiItrate
cIean stormwater to recharge groundwater, use recycIed water, dry scrape manured areas,
catch rainwater in basins for re-use, practice no-tiIl on pastures and cropIands, reduce
freshwater use where possibIe, etc.)-
As listed in exampIes above, the dairy never has bare soiIs. Water is used at agronomic rates on the
soiIs. We repair leaks daiIy, and storm water is discharged to vegetated areas which are significant
buffered before entering watercourse. The dairy aIso has no-tiIl practices. AIso, as a regenerativeIy
certified farm, our 13-16 organic matter in soiIs can store 20,000 gal/acre for every 1 organic
