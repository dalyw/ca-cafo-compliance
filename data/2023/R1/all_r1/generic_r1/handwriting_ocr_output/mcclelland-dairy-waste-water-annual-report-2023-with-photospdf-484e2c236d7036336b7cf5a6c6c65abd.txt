1. Nutrient Management for Dairies that Apply Nutrients to Pastures or Cropland

Has a Nutrient Management Plan (NMP per MRP-Appendix 2) been prepared or revised for the dairy?  
Yes 🗙 No ☐

If yes, what is the year the NMP is or will be finalized and who completed the NMP?  
Year of NMP: April 2019  
Technical Service Provider/Approving Agency: Jeff Creque & Lee Erickson Via NRCS  
Number of acres of pasture: Changes annually  
Number of acres of other crops and crop type: Changes annually

For facilities with a prepared Nutrient Management Plan (NMP):

How has the dairy NMP been implemented within the past year?  
We monitor our fields, track manure applications, and irrigation events. We base our crop rotations on this observed information.

Describe pasture or crop rotation practices and other management practices implemented during the past year to ensure nutrients applied to pasture or croplands were applied at agronomic rates. Provide the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) budget calculations for each applicable field/crop type for the past year to demonstrate whether nutrients applied were at agronomic rates. If sampling of manure, process water, soil, and/or plant tissue was completed in the past year, please demonstrate how these results were utilized in the nutrient budget calculations:  
Rotations are based on forage yields, weather conditions, pasture observations, and season.

Is the dairy in compliance with NMP requirements for manure, soil, and plant tissue sampling?  
Yes 🗙 No ☐

If so, provide the nutrient budget calculations to demonstrate that the dairy is applying nutrients at agronomic rates:  
Nutrient budgets are determined by seasonal conditions and observed yields. CNMP dictates how we amend pastures.

Please add any comments regarding soil sampling results such as plans to adjust nutrient application rates at specific locations to meet agronomic rates:  
We sample soils regularly to determine soil health

K. Tribal Cultural Resources Protection

The Tribal Cultural Resources Mitigation Program (GWDR - Attachment E) is required. Dairy operators must familiarize themselves with this information and follow the steps indicated if archaeological resources are discovered.

Is the dairy compliant with the TCRMP? Yes 🗶 No ☐

L. Water Conservation

The GWDR encourages water conservation. The Water Quality Plan, section J, discusses the importance of water conservation. Please describe the water conservation measures practiced within the past year on the dairy including pastures and cropland that help to conserve water. (Examples: vegetate bare soil areas, use water efficiently, repair leaks in a timely manner, utilize rain gutters on buildings and discharge the clean stormwater to vegetated areas, infiltrate clean stormwater to recharge groundwater, use recycled water, dry scrape manured areas, catch rainwater in basins for re-use, practice no-till on pastures and croplands, reduce freshwater use where possible, etc.):

We utilize no-till practices, compost is applied to retain soil moisture. We recycle flush water and plate cooler water. We recycle tail water off of corrals.

M. Riparian Management Planning

The Riparian Management Plan (RMP) is located at the end of the Water Quality Plan - Appendix 1.

Does the owned and leased dairy property, including the production area, pastures, and cropland, contain areas along creeks or small drainages that flow between storm events? Yes 🗶 No ☐

If yes, please specify the actions within the past year that are being taken to protect this area including riparian vegetation growing along streams and other watercourses:

No Changes to 2021 RMP

The RMP is to be submitted to the Regional Water Board by November 30, 2020 [Extended to July 1, 2021].

Is the RMP for the dairy completed and submitted? Yes 🗶 No ☐ N/A ☐

Does the dairy comply with the performance measures of the RMP? Yes 🗶 No ☐ N/A ☐

If not, what is the plan to comply with the RMP including timing of improvements?
