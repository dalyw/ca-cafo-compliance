Detailed Narrative
Chain of Custody Notes
Date: 6/14/2023

Note: Due to instrumentation issues, the nitrate and nitrite samples were subcontracted to Moore Twining
Labs. The samples were subcontracted within temperature and holding time, but a coincidental and
unforseen instrument issue at Moore Twining occurred and the AGF1167-04 sample was not analyzed within
the 48 hour method specific holding time. Authorization from Maidson Looper to report with qualification.
Data Qualifiers
The following qualifiers have been applied to one or more analytical results:
MS1.0 Matrix spike recoveries exceed control limits.
MS2.1 MS/MSD RPD exceeds control limit. Reportable results in parent sample may have some degree of variability, higher
than that inherent in the method.

Certificate of Analysis
Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible .

HT5 The hold time was missed due to instrument failure. The sample was later analyzed outside of hold time.
MS3 Recovery for this analyte was biased low; associated blank spike recoveries are within range.
RPD3 The RPD is out of range for this spike and its duplicate due to a low or high bias of one of the two spikes.

This graph estimates how many gallons of water and waste are sent to the wastewater storage ponds (lagoons) on
your dairy during the selected 120 day storage period.

Your wastewater storage ponds (lagoons) must be very close to empty as a result of applying nutrients to crops over
the last year starting in the beginning of October and should not fill before February.

Existing Storage Capacity: 1,923,194 gallons
Required Storage Capacity: 243,310 gallons
Storage Capacity Difference: 1,679,884 gallons

The estimated pond capacity appears to be adequate.

Copies of this assessment shall be maintained for 10 years.

This graph estimates the total pounds of nitrogen excreted from the herd ending up in storage, imported, removed by all crops
associated with the dairy, exported (typically as dry manure), and balance, excess, or deficiency on an annual basis.

Nutrients must be applied at rates and times appropriate for the crop to prevent surfacewater and groundwater degradation.

Total nitrogen in storage (after 30% ammonia loss): 1,661 pounds
Nitrogen imported (includes AND*): 507,700 pounds
Nitrogen exported (as manure): 0 pounds
Nitrogen removed by crops: 715,647 pounds
Nitrogen excess or deficiency: -206,287 pounds
Whole farm nitrogen balance ratio: 0.71 (regulatory limit 1.65**)

It appears that the crop rotation may be capable of removing the nitrogen applied on an annual basis.

* AND = Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition

** Whole Farm Nitrogen Balance alone does not assure compliance, you cannot list cropland acreage or claim nutrient
uptake for cropland that lacks infrastructure for controlled nutrient applications at agronomic rates and times.

Nitrogen balance ratio = (Total nitrogen in storage - Nitrogen exported + Nitrogen in irrigation water + Nitrogen imports) / Crop removal
