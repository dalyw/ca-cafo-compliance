ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Wells 3E and 003E are under repair and did not run in 2023.

Dairy received extra surface water in 2023.
2QTR Wastewater was averaged between 1QTR and 3QTR, the values from lab were too high, they compare to weak sludge, not well maintained lagoon water

which received extra rain dilution water.
No export of dry manure in 2023, NOV 2022 pond volume was very low, therefore substituted dry manure for liquid.

2023 Groundwater Well Report

Dairy: Sozinho Dairy #2 Address: 8489 E. Elkhorn Ave
Contact: Danny Sozinho Selma, CA 93662
Summary

Five wells and one canal were sampled at the Sozinho Dairy #2 by JMLord, Inc. personnel. Samples were
collected on July 17th, October 16th, November 21st, and December 20th of 2023. The samples collected are
listed below. Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured in the laboratory. Ammonium presence was measured
in the field using test strips. Results were recorded on the sampling record for each sample collected.

Samples were collected in bottles provided by the testing laboratory. The samples were placed in a cooler with
ice packs and delivered to BSK Analytical Laboratories, an ELAP laboratory. Well samples were analyzed as
defined in the MRP, updated in February 2011. The five year analysis was performed on approximately 20% of
the wells sampled.

Wells Sampled Date Sampled

Canal 7/17/2023

Well OSE 11/21/2023
South Dairy Well 10/16/2023
Domestic Well 10/16/2023
Well 1E 12/20/2023

Dairy Well (DOM) 10/16/2023

Due to the abundance of surface water, Well 3E and Well 003E were not turned on for irrigation purposes. They
were not sampled for the 2023 crop year.

Attached are copies of the field records developed when samples were collected, the Chain of Custody forms, a
map showing well locations, and the analytical results from BSK Analytical Laboratories.

The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
Jaboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated), Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.

40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2} - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropy!) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved

ASSOCIATES Certificate of Analysis
Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSi's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance,
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated), Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trinalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyt) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

AS S 0 Cl A TE S Certificate of Analysis
Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropy!) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible .
