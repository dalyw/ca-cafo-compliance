ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.
Irrigation wells MTD 7, 18, and 26 were non-operational during 2023 and will be sampled once the wells become operational.

Fields M104 Winter Forage, M104 Corn, M201 Almonds, M204 Almonds, M205 Almonds, M208 Grapes, M209 Almonds & M210 Almonds had lower than
anticipated removal rates due to lower than anticipated %N 8&/or low tonnage. This resulted in field ratios slightly exceeding target limits.

Fields M101 Corn, M109 Winter Forage, & M207 Grapes had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than expected yields and/or a lower
than expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields matched the low
removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of 1.4.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields M110 Almonds, M201-205 Almonds, M207 Grapes, M208 Grapes, & M209-211 Almonds received no wastewater or solid manure in 2023. All nutrients
applied to these fields were contributed through freshwater applications and commercial fertilizer only.

Field M211 Almonds are newly planted almonds and therefore had no production in 2023.

Fields M206 & M212 were fallow during the 2023 summer cropping season.
