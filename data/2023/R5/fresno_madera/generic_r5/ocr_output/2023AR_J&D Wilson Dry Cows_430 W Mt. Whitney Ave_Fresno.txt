ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

All of the wells that were sampled came out negative for Ammonia which we tested onsite with a test strip .

There are only heifers at the facility, so no wastewater was created since the barn was not running.

We had an extremely wet year and had early flood release water and then Canal water thru the whole year so no wells were turned on .
