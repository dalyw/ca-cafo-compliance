Notes:
1. Generated totals are the sum of what was applied to all land application areas and what was transferred to others. See Attachment E for
individual field applications and Attachment G for individual transfers .
2. Dry tons are calculated by:

Dry Tons = Tons As-Is * (100-sample moisture %) / 100
3. Solid manure nutrient pounds applied are calculated by:

Total (N,P,K,Salts) Ibs = (Dry Tons)*((%N,P,K,Ash)/100)*2,000
4. Process wastewater nutrient pounds applied are calculated by:

Total (P,K,Salts) lbs = (Gallons)*(P,K, TDS mg/I)*(8.337E-06)

Total (N) Ibs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+TKN mg/I)*(8.337E-06)
5. All solid manure applied is considered as the organic form of nitrogen. Inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen in process wastewater are
calculated by:

Inorganic N Ibs = (Gallons)*(NO3-N+NH4-N mg/I)*(8.337E-06)

Organic N Ibs = (Gallons)*(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)*(8.337E-06)
6. Estimated total salt content in solid manure is determined by fixed solids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disolved solids. These are
not direct relationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary widely in a sample if corral dirt becomes part of the sample.
Also, ash content is only required to be analyzed once every two years. The latest resultant value is applied to any subsequent applications.

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season.

PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through

mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Nitrogen Balance Ratio - Applied to Removed
(Nitrogen values presented as Ibs/acre)

Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crop's growing season.

PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through

mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.
