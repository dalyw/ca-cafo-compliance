ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells IFF 2, 4, 11, 22, 37, 59, 61, 73, 82, 82 & 100 were non-operational or not used in 2023. All wells will be sampled once the wells become
operational and/or used during the cropping season. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a greater amount of surface water allocation to grow
crops.

Field 1103 Corn, 1403 Almonds, 1801 Almonds, 11201 Almonds, & 11301 Almonds had lower than anticipated removal rates due to lower than anticipated %N or
extremely low tonnage. This resulted in field ratios slightly exceeding target limits. 11301 Almonds field received commercial fertilizer only and received no solid
manure or wastewater in 2023. 11301 also had low removals due to water issues causing the orchard to be in poor condition.

Fields 1409 Rye Grass, 1103 Corn, 1201 Tomatoes, 1205 Tomatoes, & 1506 Tomatoes had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than
expected yields and/or a lower than expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to
these fields matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of 1.4.

Fields 1102-105 Rye Grass, 1201 Rye Grass, 1205 Rye Grass, 1208 Rye Grass, & | 1102 Rye Grass had higher than anticipated removal rates. This was due to
much higher than expected %N and/or yield. The %N removed, which is based on analysis derived through a certified laboratory, exceeded the anticipated
values for this crop. Appropriate management practices resulted in decent yields and/or higher than expected nutrient removal rates.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields 1101 Almonds, 201 Tomatoes, 1205 Tomatoes, 1405-408 Almonds. 1501-504 Almonds, I506 Tomatoes, & 11301 Almonds received no wastewater or solid
manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to these fields were contributed through freshwater applications and/or commercial fertilizer only.

Fields 1405-408 & 1501-504 Almonds are newly planted almonds and therefore had no production in 2023.

Fields 1210, 1211, 1802, & 11101 Almonds were removed early 2023 and were fallow for field work.

Fields 11103 & 11104 were fallow during the winter cropping season 2023.
