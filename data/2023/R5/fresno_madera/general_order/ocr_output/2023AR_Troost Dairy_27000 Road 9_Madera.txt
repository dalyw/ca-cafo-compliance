ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized to meet freshwater needs of winter forage.

Irrigation wells 13, 13-2, 13-D, 15, 16, & 167 were not used or not operational in 2023. All wells will be sampled once the wells become operational and used
during the cropping season. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a greater amount of surface water allocation to grow crops. IW 7 has been retired
and will no longer be in use.

Fields Delta 1 Winter Forage, Delta 2 Winter Forage, 407 Corn, 415 Corn, 420 Corn, 421 Corn, Delta 1 Corn, Delta 2 Corn, Delta 3 Corn, Delta 4 Corn & 410
Alfalfa had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than expected yields and/or lower than expected %N. The %N removed, which is based
on analysis derived through a certified laboratory, did not meet the anticipated values for these crops. Nutrient removal rates were lower than expected yet the
1.4 threshold was met.

Fields Delta 3 Winter Forage, Delta 4 Winter Forage, 417 Almonds, 418 Almonds, & 419 Almonds had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to a
lower than expected yield and/or lower than expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. The low removal rate
resulted in a field ratio slightly exceeding target limits, even though application rates did not exceed expected removals.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields 403A Almonds, 403B Almonds, 404 Almonds, 410 Alfalfa, 412B Almonds, 417 Almonds, 418 Almonds, & 419 Almonds received no wastewater or solid
manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to these fields was contributed through freshwater applications and/or commercial fertilizer only.

Fields 420 & 421 were fallow during the 2023 winter cropping season. Fields Delta 5A, Delta 5B, Delta 5C, and Delta 5D were fallow all of 2023.
