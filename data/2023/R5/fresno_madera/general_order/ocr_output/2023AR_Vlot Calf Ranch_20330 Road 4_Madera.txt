ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells VCR DW 3, 12, 23, 25, & 30 were non-operational in 2023. All wells will be sampled once the wells become operational and used during the
cropping season. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a greater amount of surface water allocation to grow crops.

Fields 23W Winter Forage, 1CCF Winter Forage, 2CCF Winter Forage, 3CCF Winter Forage, 12 Alfalfa/Grass Mix, 15 Alfalfa/Grass Mix, 16 Alfalfa/Grass Mix,
21 Alfalfa/Grass Mix, 5CCF Almonds, 7CCF Almonds, 10CCF Almonds, 11CCF Almonds, 12CCF Almonds, & 14CCF Almonds had lower than anticipated
removal rates. This was due to lower than expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the
applications to these fields matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of 1.4.

Fields 1CCFH Winter Forage, 2CCFH Winter Forage, 3CCFH Winter Forage, 4CCFH Winter Forage, 1CCF Corn, 3CCF Corn, 1CCFH Corn, & 14 Grass Blend
(TEFT) had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than expected yields and expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was

derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of
1.4.

Fields 6CCF Almonds, 8CCF Almonds, 9CCF Almonds, & 13CCF Almonds had lower a than anticipated removal rates, which was due to low tonnage and %N.
This resulted in field ratios slightly exceeding target limits.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields 3 Alfalfa, 6 Alfalfa, 19 Alfalfa, 20 Alfalfa, 5CCF Almonds, 6CCF Almonds, 7CCF Almonds, 8CCF Almonds, 9CCF Almonds, 10CCF Almonds, 11CCF
Almonds, 12CCF Almonds, 13CCF Almonds, & 14CCF Almonds received no wastewater or solid manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to these fields were

contributed through freshwater applications and/or commercial fertilizer only.

Field 11 was fallow during the 2023 cropping season. Field 15 was fallow during the summer crop 2023.
