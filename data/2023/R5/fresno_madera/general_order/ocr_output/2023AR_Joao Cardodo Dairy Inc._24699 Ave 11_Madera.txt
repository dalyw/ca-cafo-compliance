ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Irrigation well |W #1 was non-operational in 2023 and will be sampled once the well becomes operational. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a
winter crop to be grown.

Fields 1 Winter Forage Hay, 2 Winter Forage Hay, & 3 Winter Forage Hay had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than expected yields
and expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields matched the low
removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of 1.4.

Fields #1, 2, & 3 were fallow summer 2023. This was due to no irrigation/surface water being available to the producer.

All solid manure that was generated was exported offsite .
