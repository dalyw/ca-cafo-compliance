ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Ag Well 2 is still dry.

Shop well is still dry.

All fields exceed 40 acres. Two samples taken of each crop and samples averaged for submittal purposes .

Deep Wells were not used in 2023. Producer did not have the finances to have pumps turned on for electrical service for sampling purposes only.
Fields A & B Wheat Silage were low in moisture. This may have skewed the N extraction ratio causing a negative nutrient value.

Ag Well 2 is still dry.

Shop well is still dry.

All fields exceed 40 acres. Two samples taken of each crop and samples averaged for submittal purposes .

Deep Wells were not used in 2023. Producer did not have the finances to have pumps turned on for electrical service for sampling purposes only.
Fields A & B Wheat Silage were low in moisture. This may have skewed the N extraction ratio causing a negative nutrient value.
