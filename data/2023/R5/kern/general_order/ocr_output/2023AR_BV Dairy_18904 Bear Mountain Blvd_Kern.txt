ATTACHMENTS
A. REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS

The following lists the required documents that should be attached to the Annual Report when submitted .
Annual Dairy Facility Assessment

Provide an Annual Dairy Facility Assessment (an update to the Preliminary Dairy Facility Assessment in Attachment A) for each reporting period. On the PDFA Final
page, click on the ADFA Report button to generate an ADFA report after updating information as needed .

Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests

Provide copies of all manure/process wastewater tracking manifests for the reporting period, signed by both the owner/operator and the hauler.

Corrective Actions Documents

Provide records documenting any corrective actions taken to correct deficiencies noted as a result of the inspections required in the Monitoring Requirements of the
General Order. Deficiencies not corrected in 30 days must be accompanied by an explanation of the factors preventing immediate correction.

Groundwater Monitoring

Dischargers that monitor supply wells or subsurface (tile) drainage systems, or that have monitoring well systems must submit monitoring results as directed in the
General Order, Groundwater Reporting Section starting on page MRP-13.

Storm Water Monitoring

Dischargers that are required to monitor storm water more frequently than required in the General Order must submit monitoring results as directed in the General Order,

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD__ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.

DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.

Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.

LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.

MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.

MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based

on the LCS or CCV recovery.
