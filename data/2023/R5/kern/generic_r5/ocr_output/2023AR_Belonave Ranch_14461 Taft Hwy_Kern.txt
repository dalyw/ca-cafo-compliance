Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

2023 Groundwater Well Report

Dairy: Belonave Ranch LLC Address: 14461 Taft Highway
Contact: George Borba Bakersfield, CA 93311

summary
Seventeen wells were sampled at the Belonave Ranch LLC by dairy personnel. The samples collected are listed below.
Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured in the laboratory. Ammonium presence was measured in the field using test
strips. Results were recorded on the sampling record for each sample collected. Samples were collected in bottles
provided by the testing laboratory. The samples were placed in a cooler with ice packs and delivered to BSK Analytical
Laboratories, an ELAP laboratory. Well samples were analyzed as defined in the MRP, updated in February 2011.

RE: Report for AGK2679 RBS5 Well 5 Year

Dear George Borba,

Thank you for using BSK Associates for your analytical testing needs. In the following pages, you will
find the test results for the samples submitted to our laboratory on 11/20/2023. The results have been
approved for release by our Laboratory Director as indicated by the authorizing signature below.

The samples were analyzed for the test(s) indicated on the Chain of Custody (see attached) and the
results relate only to the samples analyzed. BSK certifies that the testing was performed in
accordance with the quality system requirements specified in the 2016 TNI Standard. Any deviations
from this standard or from the method requirements for each test procedure performed will be
annotated alongside the analytical result or noted in the Case Narrative. Unless otherwise noted, the
sample results are reported on an “as received” basis.

This certificate of analysis shall not be reproduced except in full, without written approval of the laboratory.

If additional clarification of any information is required, please contact your Project Manager,
Michelle Croft , at 559-497-2888.

Thank you again for using BSK Associates. We value your business and appreciate your loyalty.

Notes:

The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.

Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.

All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB} to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed,

Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.

J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.

(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.

Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.

Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.

RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.

Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.

The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.

(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.

Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.
