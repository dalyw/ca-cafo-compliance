Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.
The results in this report apply to the samples analyzed in AGI1454 FINAL 09272023 1031
