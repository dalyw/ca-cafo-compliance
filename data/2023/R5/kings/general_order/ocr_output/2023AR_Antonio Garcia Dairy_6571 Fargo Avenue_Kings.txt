ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells Grangeville North was non-operational in 2023 and will be sampled once the well becomes operational and used during the cropping season.
Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for sufficient amounts of surface water to grow crops .

Field Cardoza Corn had a lower than anticipated removal rate. This was due to a lower than expected yield and lower than expected %N. The %N was based on
analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field
ratio threshold of 1.4.

Field Home Place Corn had a lower than anticipated removal rate due to lower than anticipated %N and low tonnage. This resulted in field ratios slightly
exceeding target limits.

Field Grangeville Wheat was flooded out in 2023. This was due to unforeseen sustained heavy rain events that led to the levee of the canal breaking and
flooding the entire field resulting in complete crop loss.
