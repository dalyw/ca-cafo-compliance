ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Dairy was only partially used in 2022, renter moved out in October 2022.

Do to 2023 wet year, Ag wells were left off to avoid PGE demand charges. Ditch water was available early and late into crop season. Initial wheat irrigation was
from 2022.

Many of the wheat and corn tissue tests were higher than expected, this is resulting in low nitrogen rations.

The manure test result for spring was low and the fall sample was higher than expected, used fall result.

Manure was stored from last year and used this year.

2023 Groundwater Well Report

Dairy: LuAr Dairy Address: 6121 15th Avenue
Contact: Julie Simas Hanford, CA 93230
Summary

Three wells and no canals were sampled at the LuAr Dairy by JMLord personal. Samples were collected in
October 2023. The samples collected are listed below. Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured in the
laboratory. Samples were collected in bottles provided by the testing laboratory. The samples were placed in a
cooler with ice packs and picked up by JMLord personnel then delivered to BSK Analytical Laboratories, an ELAP
laboratory. Well samples were analyzed as defined in the MRP, updated in February 2011. The five year analysis
was performed on approximately 20% of the wells sampled.

Wells Sampled Canals Sampled
W-4 Map 2
W-2 Map 1
Barn Well

W3M1 and W4M1: Wells not sampled, but were used. Both wells had been scheduled for maintence.
Due to maintenance issues these wells had to be utilized for limited use.

Canals were not tested due to changes by the ELAP laboratory and its invoicing policy.

Invoicing issues have been resolved but canal samples were spoiled.

Attached are copies of the field records developed when samples were collected, the Chain of Custody forms and
the analytical results from BSK Analytical Laboratories. The following wells were not opperated in 2023, due to
abundant surface water: W-2 Map 3, W-4 Map 1, W-5 Map 1, W-1 Map 2, W-3 Map 2, W-3 Map 3, W-4 Map 2, W-
4 Map 3.

FYI: The regulatory limit for Nitrate as NO3N is 10 mg/L.

from this standard or from the method requirements for each test procedure performed will be
annotated alongside the analytical result or noted in the Case Narrative. Unless otherwise noted, the
sample results are reported on an “as received” basis.

This certificate of analysis shall not be reproduced except in full, without written approval of the laboratory.

If additional clarification of any information is required, please contact your Project Manager,
PM Staff , at 559-497-2888.

Thank you again for using BSK Associates. We value your business and appreciate your loyalty.

Sincerely,

—

Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.

Notes:
The Chain of Custody document and Sample Integrity Sheet are part of the analytical report.
Any remaining sample(s) for testing will be disposed of according to BSK's sample retention policy unless other arrangements are made in
advance.
All positive results for EPA Methods 504.1 and 524.2 require the analysis of a Field Reagent Blank (FRB) to confirm that the results are not
a contamination error from field sampling steps. If Field Reagent Blanks were not submitted with the samples, this method requirement has
not been performed.
Samples collected by BSK Analytical Laboratories were collected in accordance with the BSK Sampling and Collection Standard Operating
Procedures.
J-value is equivalent to DNQ (Detected, not quantified) which is a trace value. A trace value is an analyte detected between the MDL and the
laboratory reporting limit. This result is of an unknown data quality and is only qualitative (estimated). Baseline noise, calibration curve
extrapolation below the lowest calibrator, method blank detections, and integration artifacts can all produce apparent DNQ values, which
contribute to the un-reliability of these values.
(1) - Residual chlorine and pH analysis have a 15 minute holding time for both drinking and waste water samples as defined by the EPA and
40 CFR 136. Waste water and ground water (monitoring well) samples must be field filtered to meet the 15 minute holding time for dissolved
metals.
Field tests are outside the scope of laboratory accreditation and there is no certification available for field testing.
Summations of analytes (i.e. Total Trihalomethanes) may appear to add individual amounts incorrectly, due to rounding of analyte values
occurring before or after the total value is calculated, as well as rounding of the total value.
RL Multiplier is the factor used to adjust the reporting limit (RL) due to variations in sample preparation procedures and dilutions required for
matrix interferences.
Due to the subjective nature of the Threshold Odor Method, all characterizations of the detected odor are the opinion of the panel of
analysts. The characterizations can be found in Standard Methods 2170B Figure 2170:1.
The MCLs provided in this report (if applicable) represent the primary MCLs for that analyte.
(2) - Formerly known as Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) ether.
Unless otherwise noted, TOC results by SM 5310C method do not include purgeable organic carbon, which is removed along with the
inorganic carbon interference. The POC contribution to TOC is considered to be negligible.
