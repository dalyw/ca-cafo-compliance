Annual Report - General Order No. R5-2007-0035
Reporting period 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023.
ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

1. As stated in the Annual Report, and required by the General Order, the dairies onsite Nutrient Management Plan has been updated and completed by a
certified agronomist. The dairy conducts its nutrient budgeting based on this certified plan, and only uses the Annual Report as a complimentary guide.
Submission of the nutrient budget in this annual report is done solely to satisfy the requirements of the General Orders monitoring and reporting section.

2. All graphs in the annual report display an amount of applied and removed salt. There are many ways inputs and exports of salt can accounted for. The
Merced County website does not account for all of them. The graphs convey a partial / incomplete portrayal of salts (depending on how salts are defined,
measured, and evaluated).

3. The General Order requires the submission of all land applications in the "calendar year" of the reporting period. This has been submitted. However, land
applications that occur post harvest of the Fall forage of the previous calendar year are intended for the use of the Spring forage of the following calendar year
(reporting period) as crop cycles do not work on calendar year dates. When such land applications occur in the previous calendar year, previous years analytical
data representing the applications have been inputted to represent nutrients intended for the reporting periods Spring crop. As such, any land application that
occurs post harvest of the Fall forage in the reporting period that is intended for the Spring forage of the following calendar year will not be inputted until the
following years Annual Report so that the Merced County reporting program software does not mistakenly apply these applications to the incorrect crops as
there is no way to accurately differentiate and display this situation in the Annual Report software .

4. All wastewater land applications were summarized by quarter using the corresponding wastewater quarterly sample to represent nutrient amounts applied.
One application date per quarter per crop has been selected to represent all applications of wastewater for that crop during that quarter. The Annual Reports'
nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper quarterly sample has been selected to represent nutrients applied during that
specific quarter. Day specific records are kept on site and available upon request.

All fresh water land applications during the report period have been summarized into one application per source per crop. One application date has been
selected to represent the reporting period for that crop. The Annual Reports' nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper
source sample has been selected to represent nutrients applied during the reporting period. Day specific records are kept on site and available upon request.

5. The Annual Report program lists the possibility of the report being incomplete. The report is complete. There were no samples of alfalfa hay taken during the
reporting period as no waste was applied to the crop.

6. Due to high volumes of available canal water, most, if not all wells remained idle during the growing season. Therefore little to no well samples exist. They will
be sampled again when operable.

ATTACHMENTS
A. REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS

The following lists the required documents that should be attached to the Annual Report when submitted .
Annual Dairy Facility Assessment

Provide an Annual Dairy Facility Assessment (an update to the Preliminary Dairy Facility Assessment in Attachment A) for each reporting period. On the PDFA Final
page, click on the ADFA Report button to generate an ADFA report after updating information as needed .

Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests

Provide copies of all manure/process wastewater tracking manifests for the reporting period, signed by both the owner/operator and the hauler.

Corrective Actions Documents

Provide records documenting any corrective actions taken to correct deficiencies noted as a result of the inspections required in the Monitoring Requirements of the
General Order. Deficiencies not corrected in 30 days must be accompanied by an explanation of the factors preventing immediate correction.

Groundwater Monitoring

Dischargers that monitor supply wells or subsurface (tile) drainage systems, or that have monitoring well systems must submit monitoring results as directed in the
General Order, Groundwater Reporting Section starting on page MRP-13.

Storm Water Monitoring

Dischargers that are required to monitor storm water more frequently than required in the General Order must submit monitoring results as directed in the General Order,
Storm Water Reporting Section on page MRP-14.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
