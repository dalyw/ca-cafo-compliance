ADDITIONAL NOTES
A. NOTES
1.) This facility has no crop land just Dairy Only.
2.) During December 2022 through March 2023 with excessive rains, we had seepage of piled manure along west side of corrals on an access road, while we
were trying to have the manure pile removed, we encountered run off from the pile, we will be scrapping west side of access road on neighboring field and
adding larger berm. In the future we will not be piling manure in that area it was a plan so loaders could get into & load, with the rains it was an epic fail.
3.) Please notice that Soil samples are not entered on annual report since there is no crop land on this facility. a copy was sent in by e-mail to address the
inspection report.
4.) December of 2023 our lease had expired, in short, we have relocated our dairy to a new location. With no cooperation from owners, we believe it was in our
best interest with no options for waste to be distributed (Manure & Lagoon) all of our efforts have been fruitless at this facility. All suggestions have been met by
my Husband & myself with little to no results at this location.
