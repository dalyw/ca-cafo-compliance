5 Nutrient applications shown in Attachment B are on a crop year basis.

4 Lab sample data results for applications are based on the sample taken closest to the application date. Lab sample data results are shown on 100% dry basis for manure applications
and harvest events.

5 Well Avg: Irrigation source representing the average nutrient values of all irrigation wells sampled for the facility during the reporting year.

** Book Value: No sample data results were available. For manure applications and plant tissue harvests, the calculations were based off book values.

Nutrient Applications (Attachment B)

FIELD NITROGEN RATIO Calculation:

‘Field Nitrogen Ratio” = “Total Nitrogen Applied to Field” / “Total Nitrogen Extracted from Field at Harvest”

ATMOSHERIC DEPOSITION Applied (Ibs) Calculation:

“Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = "14 Lbs (per year) * “Acres Planted”
HARVEST Nitrogen Extraction (Lbs) Calculation:

“Nitrogen Extracted (Lbs)” = ("Yield (tons per acre) * 2000) * ((100 - "% Moisture") / 100 * "Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value" / 100) * "Acres Planted"
IRRIGATION Nitrogen and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

“Nitr ied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

“Salts Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
PROCESS WASTEWATER Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

Phosphorus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data Potassium Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”
Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * (“Lab Sample Data TDS Value” * 0.000001) * “Acres Planted”

SOLID MANURE (Corral, Separator, or Compost) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Salts Applied (Lbs) Calculations:

Nitrogen Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Nitrogen Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Phosphorus Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Phosphorus Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
P. i i ” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Potassium Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”
Salt Applied (Lbs)” = “Lbs Applied per Acre” (see below) * ((100 - “% Moisture”)/100 * “Lab Sample Data Ash Value”/100) * “Acres Planted”

“Lbs Applied per Acre” Calculations:
If “Application Units” = Tons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 2000
If “Application Units” = Acres Inches, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 *27,154.3
If “Application Units” = Acre Feet, Then Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount” (per Acre) * 8.33 * 325,851
If “Application Units” = Gallons, Then “Lbs Applied per Acre” = “Application Amount’ (per Acre) * 8.33

Definition
<% : High Sample Background - Spike concentration was less than one forth of the sample concentration.
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
LCs: : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

Definition :
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
LCs : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.
ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation.
406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based

on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank : Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
LGs : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an

indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD _ : MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and

analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.

Explanation

406 : Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
