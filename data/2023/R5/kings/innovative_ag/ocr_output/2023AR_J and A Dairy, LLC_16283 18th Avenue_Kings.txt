Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifest

Instructions:

1, Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last
for several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2. If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

. The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling

event.

4. The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the

Annual Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.

Existing Milk Cow Dairies

Instructions:

1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last for
several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.

4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual
Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.

: Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.

DQO : Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.

Dup : Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.

LCS : Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.

MS : Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.

MSD : Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

MSRPD_: MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.

ND : Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
