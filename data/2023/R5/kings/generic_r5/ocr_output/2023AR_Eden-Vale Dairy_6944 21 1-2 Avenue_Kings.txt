ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES
Irrigation weIls were not utiIized during 2023 due to excessive amounts of rain during the winter season. However, aIl irrigation weIls were stiIl sampIed. Surface
water was at 100 aIlocation and therefore was the onIy irrigation source used during the 2023 cropping season.
No animaIs on site in 2023, with aIl animaIs being removed JuIy 2022. Since JuIy 2022, the owner of the faciIity has been cIeaning and deconstructing the faciIity
for cIosure. AIl ponds have been cIeaned out and barns have been removed. Most manure on the faciIity was removed FaIl of 2022 and earIy 2023. AIl crops
were removed spring 2022 and pIanted in Pistachios Summer of 2022. FieId 9 was not part of the saIe of Eden VaIe Dairy and no longer associated with the
faciIity.
No wastewater sampIes were taken in 2023 due to no wastewater generation because of the cIosure process of the dairy. No water avaiIabIe for sampIing.
