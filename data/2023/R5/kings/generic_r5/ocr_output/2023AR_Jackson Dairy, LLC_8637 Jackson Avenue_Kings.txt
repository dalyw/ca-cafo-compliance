Definition
BIank Method BIank. Prepared to verify that-the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the sampIes.
DEO Data QuaIity Objective - This is the criteria against which the quaIity control data.is compared.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/SampIe - Prepared to verify that the preparation prdcess is not affecting anaIyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sampIe is spiked with a known amount of anaIyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sampIe matrix
affects anaIyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike DupIicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sampIe dupIicate is spiked with a known amount of anaIyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sampIe matrix affects anaIyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD ReIative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS reIative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
anaIysis.
ND Non-detect - ResuIt was beIow the DQO listed for the anaIyte.
ExpIanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high anaIyte concentration in the sampIe. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
435 SampIe matrix may be affecting this anaIyte. Data was accepted hased on the LCS or CCV recovery.
