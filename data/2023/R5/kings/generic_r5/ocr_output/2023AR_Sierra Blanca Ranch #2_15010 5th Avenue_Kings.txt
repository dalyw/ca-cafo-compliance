BIank Method BIank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the sampIes.
DQO Data QuaIity Objective - This is the criteria against which the quaIity control data is compared.
Dup DupIicate SampIe - A random sampIe with each batch is prepared and anaIyzed in dupIicate. The reIative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and anaIysis.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/SampIe - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting anaIyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sampIe is spiked with a known amount of anaIyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sampIe matrix
affects anaIyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike DupIicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sampIe dupIicate is spiked with a known amount of anaIyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sampIe matrix affects anaIyte recovery.
MSRPD _ MS/MSD ReIative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS reIative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
anaIysis.
ND Non-detect - ResuIt was beIow the DQO listed for the anaIyte.
