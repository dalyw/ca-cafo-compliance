Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process-is not contributing contamination to the samples.
BQO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random. sample with each.batch is prepared and analyzed in-duplicate. Ths relative percent difference is an
indication. of precision for the preparation.and analysis.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affacting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A rendom sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that saniple matrix
 affects analyte recovery,
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate-of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an-
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
