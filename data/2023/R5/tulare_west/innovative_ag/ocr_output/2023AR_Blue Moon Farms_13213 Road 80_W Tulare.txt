Definition
Blahk Method Blank Prepared to verify that the prepiatation process is wot vonteloutitig contamination to the samples.
Dad y Data Qudlity Objective- This is the criteria-agaitist which the quality control deta is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with-each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and.analysis.
LCs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes -.A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRFD MSIMSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
440 Sample nonhomogeneity may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.
