Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not-contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample -.A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCs r Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that-the preparation process is net affecting analyte recavery.
MS 1 Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
Bffects.dnalyte recovery.
MSD Metrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of-analyted. The recoveries are an
ivicication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
