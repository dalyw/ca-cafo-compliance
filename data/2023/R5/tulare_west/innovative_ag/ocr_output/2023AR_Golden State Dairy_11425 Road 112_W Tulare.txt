MS Matrix Spikes - Acrandom sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries arean indication.of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQo Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are.an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
435 Sample matrix may be affecting this analyte. Data was accepted based on the LCS or CCV recovery.

Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared(to verify that the preparation provess fs not-contribyting contaminationto the samples.
DQO _ Data Quality Objective - This.is the oriteria against which the quality control data is compared,
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random saniple with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate, The relative percent differante is an
indication of precision for the-preparation and analysis. .
Les Laboratory Contral Standard/Sample.- Prepared to verify thatthe preparation process is-not affegting analyte-recovery.
MS Matrie Spikes - A random sample isspiked with a knawn amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix. Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are.an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSDRelative Petcent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
