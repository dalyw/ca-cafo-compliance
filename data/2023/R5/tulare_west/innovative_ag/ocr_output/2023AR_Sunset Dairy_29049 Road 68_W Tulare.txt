MANURE/ WASTEWATER TRACKING MANIFEST
FOR
CONFINED BOVINE FEEDING OPERATIONS

Instructions .

1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last for
several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.

4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/ wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual Report
for Confined Bovine Feeding Operations. .

5) Manifests cannot be used when transferring manure or wastewater to cropland owned or controlled ,
by the owner or operator of the Confined Bovine Feeding Operation as a substitute for preparing and
implemering a Nutrient Management Pian for the cropland.

6) Manifests are not needed to document the use of manure for bedding at the operation where the
manure was generated.

Definition.
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
Dgo Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data ts. compared.
LCs . Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes.- A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that setaple matrix.
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication-of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD .-MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis,
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
