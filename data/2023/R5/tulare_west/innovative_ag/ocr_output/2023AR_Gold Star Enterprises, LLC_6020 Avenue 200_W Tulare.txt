Instructions .

1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last for
several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.

2) f there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.

3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.

4) The operator shail submit copies of manure/ wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual Report
for Confined Bovine Feeding Operations.

5) Manifests cannot be used when transferring manure or wastewater to cropland owned or controlled .
by the owner or operator of the Confined Bovine Feeding Operation as a substitute for preparing and
implemeriing a Nutrient Management Plan for the cropland. .

6) Manifests are not needed to document the use of manure for bedding at the operation where the
manure was generated.
