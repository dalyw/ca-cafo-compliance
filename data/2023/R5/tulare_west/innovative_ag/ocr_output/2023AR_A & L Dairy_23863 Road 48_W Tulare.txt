Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifest
For
Existing Milk Cow Dairies
Instructions
1) Complete one manifest for each hauling event, for each destination. A hauling event may last for
several days, as long as the manure is being hauled to the same destination.
2) If there are multiple destinations, complete a separate form for each destination.
3) The operator must obtain the signature of the hauler upon completion of each manure-hauling event.
4) The operator shall submit copies of manure/process wastewater tracking manifest(s) with the Annual
Monitoring Report for Existing Milk Cow Dairies.

Blauk. 4 -Mathod Blank Prepared to verify that-the preparation provess is not contributing contamination to the samples
DOG Data Quality Objevtive.- This is the criteria against which the quality control data ig compared.
Les Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is vot affecting analyte recovery,
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with aknown. amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are.an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
Explanation
406 Matrix Spike (MS) not within the Acceptance Range (AR) because of high analyte concentration in the sample. Data was accepted based
on the LCS or CCV recovery.
