This Annual Monitoring Report contains the required information for the period of January
01 through December 31. Field data contains information pertaining to crop activities for
all crops harvested within this period. This allows for continuity of the winter crops.

2. Herd Profile and Housing of the Dairy
The maximum and average number and type of animals, whether in open confinement or
housed under roof is provided in Attachment A.

3. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients

provided in Attachment A.

Individual applications to each field (Item 17, Record Keeping) is provided in Attachment
E.

5. Ratio of Total Nitrogen Applied to Removed for Land Application Areas

The ratio of total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied to land application areas and the
total nitrogen removed by crop harvest is provided in Attachment C.
Also provided is the Plant Available Nitrogen (PAN) ratio which includes the inorganic
nitrogen and calculates how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the
plant through mineralization for that crop. This includes both what is applied during that
growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

6. Estimated Amount of Total Manure, Process Water, and Nutrients
Transferred
The estimated total amount of manure and process wastewater transferred offsite for this
period is provided in Attachment A.

Individual transfers are documented in Attachment G.
Transfer documentation can be found in Item 13, Manure Tracking Manifests.

Notes
1. Generated totals are the sum of what was applied to all land application areas and what was transferred to others. See Attachment E for
individual field applications and Attachment G for individual transfers .
2. Dry tons are calculated by
Dry Tons Tons As-Is (100-sample moisture ) / 100
3. Solid manure nutrient pounds applied are calculated by
Total (N,P,K,Salts) lbs - (Dry Tons)((N,P,K,Ash)/100)2,000
4. Process wastewater nutrient pounds applied are calculated by
Total (P,K,Salts) Ibs (Gallons)(P,K, TDS mg/l)(8.337E-06)
Total (N) Ibs (Gallons)(NO3-NTKN mg/l)(8.337E-06)
5. All solid manure applied is considered as the organic form of nitrogen. Inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen in process wastewater are
calculated by
Inorganic N lbs (Gallons)(NO3-NNH4-N mg/I)(8.337E-06)
Organic N Ibs (Gallons)(TKN-NH4-N mg/l)(8.337E-06)
6. Estimated total salt content in solid manure is determined by fixed solids (ash) and in process wastewater by total disolved solids. These are
not direct relationships but are being used for estimation purposes. Ash can vary widely in a sample if corral dirt becomes part of the sample.
Also, ash content is only required to be analyzed once every two years. The latest resultant value is applied to any subsequent applications.

Notes
Total Balance Ratio is based on the total nitrogen (inorganic & organic) applied only during the time of that crops growing season.
PAN Balance Ratio is based on Plant Available Nitrogen. In addition to inorganic nitrogen applied, PAN takes into consideration how much of the organic nitrogen has become available to the plant through
mineralization. This includes both what is applied during that growing season and the residual amounts from previous applications to that field.

Definition
Blank __ Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
Lcs Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that.sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD_ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
a ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte. o
