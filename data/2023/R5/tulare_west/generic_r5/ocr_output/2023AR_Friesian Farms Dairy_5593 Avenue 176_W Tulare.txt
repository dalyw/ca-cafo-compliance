2023 Groundwater Well Report

Dairy: Friesian Farms Dairy Address: 5593 Avenue 176
Contact: Nonning Leyendekker Tulare, CA 93274

Summary

Fourteen wells and one canal were sampled at the Friesian Farms Dairy by DeGroot Environmental personnel.
Samples were collected on July 10, and September 20, 2023. The samples collected are listed below.
Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured in the laboratory. Ammonium presence was measured in the field
using test strips. Results were recorded on the sampling record for each sample collected. Samples were
collected in bottles provided by the testing laboratory. The samples were placed in a cooler with ice packs and
delivered to BSK Analytical Laboratories, an ELAP laboratory. Well samples were analyzed as defined in the
MRP, updated in February 2011. The five year analysis was performed on approximately 20% of the wells
sampled.

The following wells were non operational in 2022: Well #3, Well #4, Well #5, Well #9, and Well #13. No
samples could be collected from this well. Documentation is included with this report.

Groundwater Monitoring Report 2023

|. INTRODUCTION

The following is the 2023 Groundwater Monitoring Report for the Friesian Farms
Dairy facility located at 5593 Avenue 176, Tulare, Tulare County, California
(Site). The Site is located west of Road 56, and south of Avenue 176,
approximately five and one-half miles east of the City of Corcoran. The dairy site
is within Sections 10 and 14, Township 21 South, Range 23 East, Mount Diablo
Baseline and Meridian.

ll. GROUNDWATER SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT DATA

A. Monitoring Well Sampling Procedures

Provost & Pritchard Consulting Group (Provost & Pritchard) personnel
attempted to sample groundwater monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3 on
March 08 and September 06, 2023. Monitoring well MW-1 through MW-3
were dry during the March 08, 2023, sampling event. Monitoring wells MW-1
and MW-3 were dry during the September 06, 2023, sampling event.
Monitoring well MW-2 had sufficient water to allow for sampling.

When sufficient groundwater is available for sampling or measurement, static
water level is measured from the top of each PVC casing and recorded to the
nearest 0.01 foot with respect to the established casing elevation, as
possible. Each sampled monitoring well is purged a minimum of three well
volumes, as possible. Purged water is monitored for pH, electrical
conductivity (EC), and temperature.

Each monitoring well is equipped with a dedicated Waterra inertia pump and
Waterra tubing. The use of dedicated sampling equipment prevents cross-
contamination between samples and eliminates the need for field
decontamination of the equipment. Sample containers are sterilized and
transported to the field under conditions to preserve their sterility.

Groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells are placed into
laboratory prepared containers, sealed with tight fitting caps, labeled, and
stored in a cooled ice chest while awaiting delivery to Agriculture & Priority
Pollutants Laboratories (APPL), a  California-certified © Environmental
Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELAP) laboratory in Clovis, California.
The samples are analyzed for EC, nitrate as nitrogen (NOs-N), and
ammonium as nitrogen (NH,-N).

B. Groundwater Elevation Map

A Groundwater Elevation Map, based on available information, was prepared
for the March 08 and September 06, 2023, sampling events. Well locations,
depth to groundwater, and groundwater elevations for the events, as
applicable, are illustrated in Appendix A: Figure 1.
