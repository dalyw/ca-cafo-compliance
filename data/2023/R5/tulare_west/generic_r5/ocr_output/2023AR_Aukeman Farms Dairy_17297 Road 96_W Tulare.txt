ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells IW #5, 10, 17, 18, 19, & 20 were not utilized during 2023 due to excessive amounts of rain during the winter season. Surface water was at 100%
allocation and therefore more canal water was available for use during the 2023 cropping season. All irrigation wells will be sampled when used. IW #15 was
non-operational and will be sampled once the well becomes operational. |W #16 was retired from service and will be removed.

Fields #2 Wheat, 3 Wheat, 4 South Wheat, 6 South Wheat Hay, 3 Corn, & 5 South Corn had lower than anticipated removal rates. This was due to lower than
expected yields and/or expected %N. The %N was based on analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to these fields
matched the low removal rates and was able to meet the field ratio threshold of 1.4.

Nutrients applied to permanent crops, such as trees and vines, are used for tree growth, vine development and fruit production (grapes, nuts, etc.). Comparing
nutrient applications to nutrient content of harvested material for permanent crops is not appropriate and will result in high field ratios. A more accurate reporting
methodology will need to be developed in order to account for nutrients retained in the permanent crops. All applications will continue to be monitored closely to
ensure that over application of nutrients does not occur.

Fields #8 & 9 Pistachios received no wastewater or solid manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to these fields were contributed through freshwater applications
and/or commercial fertilizer only.

Fields #7, 15 & 16 were fallow during the winter cropping season for 2023.
