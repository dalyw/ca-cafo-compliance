ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation well |W #26 was non-operational in 2023 and will be sampled once the well becomes operational. Heavy rains during the winter season allowed for a
greater amount of surface water allocation to grow crops.

Field #22 Wheat had a lower than anticipated removal rate. This was due to extremely low tonnage and a lower than expected %N. The %N was based on
analysis that was derived through a certified laboratory. However, the applications to this field matched the low removal rate and was able to meet the field ratio

threshold of 1.4.

Fields #13 Wheat Hay & 23 Wheat had lower than anticipated removal rates, which was due to extremely low tonnage and lower than expected %N. This
resulted in field ratios slightly exceeding target limits.

A portion of Fields #22 & 23 Wheat suffered from weather related damage which caused a decrease in tonnage.

Field #12 was fallow during 2023, because it was used as flood protection for the facility during the unusually high amounts of rain during the winter.
