Annual Report - General Order No. R5-2007-0035
Reporting period 01/01/2023 to 12/31/2023.
ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

1. As stated in the Annual Report, and required by the General Order, the dairies onsite Nutrient Management Plan has been updated and completed by a
certified agronomist. The dairy conducts its nutrient budgeting based on this certified plan, and only uses the Annual Report as a complimentary guide.
Submission of the nutrient budget in this annual report is done solely to satisfy the requirements of the General Orders monitoring and reporting section.

2. All graphs in the annual report display an amount of applied and removed salt. There are many ways inputs and exports of salt can accounted for. The
Merced County website does not account for all of them. The graphs convey a partial / incomplete portrayal of salts (depending on how salts are defined,
measured, and evaluated).

3. The General Order requires the submission of all land applications in the "calendar year" of the reporting period. This has been submitted. However, land
applications that occur post harvest of the Fall forage of the previous calendar year are intended for the use of the Spring forage of the following calendar year
(reporting period) as crop cycles do not work on calendar year dates. When such land applications occur in the previous calendar year, previous years analytical
data representing the applications have been inputted to represent nutrients intended for the reporting periods Spring crop. As such, any land application that
occurs post harvest of the Fall forage in the reporting period that is intended for the Spring forage of the following calendar year will not be inputted until the
following years Annual Report so that the Merced County reporting program software does not mistakenly apply these applications to the incorrect crops as
there is no way to accurately differentiate and display this situation in the Annual Report software .

4. All wastewater land applications were summarized by quarter using the corresponding wastewater quarterly sample to represent nutrient amounts applied.
One application date per quarter per crop has been selected to represent all applications of wastewater for that crop during that quarter. The Annual Reports'
nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper quarterly sample has been selected to represent nutrients applied during that
specific quarter. Day specific records are kept on site and available upon request.

All fresh water land applications during the report period have been summarized into one application per source per crop. One application date has been
selected to represent the reporting period for that crop. The Annual Reports' nutrient budget is accurate to the Merced County website standards as the proper
source sample has been selected to represent nutrients applied during the reporting period. Day specific records are kept on site and available upon request.

5. The Annual Report program lists the possibility of the report being incomplete. The report is complete. There were no samples of alfalfa hay or pistachios
taken during the reporting period as no waste was applied to the crop.

6. All crop land and land application events of Curti Family Farms are controlled by Curti Family Inc., whom are the same owners as Curti Family Farms. Please
refer to Curti Family Inc.'s annual report for all crops, application events, and any other nutrient management planning for both facilities. All of Curti Family
Farms nutrient analysis are also included in Curti Family, Inc.'s annual report. As Curti Family Farms' nutrients are used for applications to cropland the
corresponding analysis is selected in Curti Family Inc.'s annual report in order to accurately reflect the activity.

7. Due to high volumes of available canal water, most, if not all wells remained idle during the growing season. Therefore little to no well samples exist. They will
be sampled again when operable.
