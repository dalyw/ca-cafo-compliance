ADDITIONAL NOTES

A. NOTES

Precipitation utilized during winter months to meet forage freshwater requirements.

Irrigation wells IW #28, 29, & 31 were not utilized during 2023 due to excessive amounts of rain during the winter season. Surface water was at 100% allocation
and therefore more canal water was available for use during the 2023 cropping season. All irrigation wells will be sampled when used.

Fields #25 & 26 Pistachios received no wastewater or solid manure in 2023. All nutrients applied to these fields were contributed through freshwater applications
only.

Fields #24, 27, 28, & 29 were fallow during the winter cropping season for 2023.
