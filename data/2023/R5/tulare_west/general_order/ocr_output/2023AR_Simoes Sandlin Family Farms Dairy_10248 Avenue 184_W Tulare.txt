Definition
Blank Method Blank - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not contributing contamination to the samples.
DQO Data Quality Objective - This is the criteria against which the quality control data is compared.
Dup Duplicate Sample - A random sample with each batch is prepared and analyzed in duplicate. The relative percent difference is an
indication of precision for the preparation and analysis.
LCS Laboratory Control Standard/Sample - Prepared to verify that the preparation process is not affecting analyte recovery.
MS Matrix Spikes - A random sample is spiked with a known amount of analyte. The recoveries are an indication of how that sample matrix
affects analyte recovery.
MSD Matrix Spike Duplicate of MS/MSD pair - A random sample duplicate is spiked with a known amount of analyted. The recoveries are an
indication of how that sample matrix affects analyte recovery.
MSRPD _ MS/MSD Relative Percent Difference (RPD) - The MS relative percent difference is an indication of precision for the preparation and
analysis.
ND Non-detect - Result was below the DQO listed for the analyte.
