Within the last year has any of the above information changed Yes If yes, pIease highIight new information.
The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compIiance updates, demonstrate that the faciIity is ready for the
rainy season, document required water quaIity monitoring and actions taken to correct identified probIems, and to
demonstrate that each faciIity is operating in compIiance with the requirements of Order No. R2-2016-0031
(General Permit).
Any discharges of waste, wastewater or contaminated stormwater that may endanger human heaIth or the
environment, must be verbaIly reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water Board
SpiIl HotIine at (510) 622-2369 and to the CaIifornia Office of Emergency Services (OES) at (800) 852-7550.

If yes, identify the resuIts of the additional sampIes conducted to isoIate the probIem, and describe
the findings. IncIude a detaiIed description of the identified poIlutant source and corrective actions

Groundwater SampIing NO WELLS ON SITE
AIl faciIities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampIing (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative weIls located within the confined faciIity, incIuding
domestic and agricuItural suppIy weIls, shaIl be sampIed 4 times total, approximateIy 6 months apart.
ResuIts of groundwater sampIes coIlected consistentIy with the sampIing protocoIs and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County HeaIth Department or by the County miIk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of coIlecting additional sampIes. The sampIe must be representative
of groundwater weIl conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater sampIes shaIl be anaIyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of HeaIth
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
