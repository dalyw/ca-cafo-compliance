Include a detailed description of the identified pollutant source and corrective actions taken (attach additional pages if necessary). Groundwater Sampling. All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart. Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames for another purpose (e. g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative of groundwater well conditions (i. e. not disinfected). Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff. Check the box below that applies.
