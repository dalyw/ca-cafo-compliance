Reporting Program (General WORs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section C, for sampling
and data analysis procedures.
Surface Water Sampling
v Check the box that applies. xGroup Monitoring Program 0 Individual Monitoring Plan
If you are not identified as participating ina Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual
surface water sampling as required in the General Permit, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during
or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling
events shall be at least 14 days apart.
1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including the proximity of the confined

Both participants of a Group Monitoring Program and facilities with an Individual Monitoring Plan, fill
out the section below.
Did any surface water samples exceed General Order benchmarks) Yes No
If yes, identify the results of the additional samples conducted to isolate the problem, and describe
the findings. Include a detailed description of the identified pollutant source and corrective actions
taken (attach additional pages if necessary).
Groundwater Sampling
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct groundwater sampling (even if you are participating in
a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including
domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart.
Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time
frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative
of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
Check the box below that applies
