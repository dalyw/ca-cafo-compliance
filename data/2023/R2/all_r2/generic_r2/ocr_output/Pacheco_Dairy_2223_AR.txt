The objective of the Annual Report is to provide compliance updates, demonstrate that the confined animal
facility is ready for the rainy season, document required water quality monitoring and actions taken to correct
identified problems, and to demonstrate that each facility is operating in compliance with the requirements of
Order No. R2-2016-0031 (General WDRs).
Any discharges of waste, waste water or contaminated storm water that may endanger human health or the
environment, must be verbally reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence to the Water
Board Spill Hotline at (510) 622-2369 and to the California Office of Emergency Services (OES) at (800)

E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section II C, for

sampling and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling

Ifyou are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surface water sampling as required in General WDRs, Attachment A. Sampling shail take place during or

directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events
shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any jab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including proximity of the confined
facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your SA, methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.)

Ground Water Sampling.
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct ground water sampling (even if you are
participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the
confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total,
. . isan ream Saeed PORE eee
approximately 6 months apart. A sample must be collected in the Fall and Spring, Results of
groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames
for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be
representative of groundwater weil conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health .
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
