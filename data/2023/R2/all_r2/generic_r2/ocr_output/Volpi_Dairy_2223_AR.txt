The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and

Reporting Program (General WDORs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section Il C, for

sampling and data analysis procedures.

e

tf you are not identified a3 participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual

surface water sampling as required in General WORs, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during or

directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events
shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including
any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including proximity of the confined
facilities and land application areas.

2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.)

Ground Water Sampiing.
All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct ground water sampling (even if you are
participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the
confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total,
approximately 6 months apart. A sample must be collected in the Fall and Spring, Results of
groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames
for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be
submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be
representative of groundwater weil conditions (i.e. not disinfected).
Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health
Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.
