☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A All uncovered confined or heavily manured areas including corrals, feeding, watering, or loafing areas, not draining into retention ponds have been scraped clean and/or otherwise protected.

☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A Alternative confined areas are readily available before and during storm events when animals must be relocated away from all uncovered confined areas not draining into retention ponds.

☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A All waste containment facilities, pumping equipment, pipes, and other conveyances have been inspected, maintained, and are free of leaks.

☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A All retention ponds have been emptied, properly maintained, and protected from inundation or washout.

☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A Retention pond liners have not been damaged during the clean-out process

☑ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A Manure and wastewater have been applied to land or stockpiled at least 100 feet from any surface water, domestic wellhead, and flood-prone or heavy run-off areas prior to November 30. (A 35-foot vegetative buffer or physical barrier can be substituted for the 100-foot setback. If such an alternative practice is used, provide details below.)

|---|---|---|---|---|   
| Specific conductance | Below 2000 µS/cm |  |  |  |  
| Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3 + NH4+) | Below 1 ppm (or mg/l) and meets calculated unionized ammonia benchmark |  |  |  |
