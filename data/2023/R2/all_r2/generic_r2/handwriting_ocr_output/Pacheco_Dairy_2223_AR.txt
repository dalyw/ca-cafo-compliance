Observations of any threats to water quality and corrective actions taken shall be documented throughout the year and reported below. Please check all that apply and explain each "No" response.

Production / Confined Area Inspections

Yes  No Did you conduct daily inspections of confined and production areas, including retention ponds, pumping equipment, water lines, corrals, travel lanes, water crossings, feed storage areas, loafing areas, etc., to confirm that:

E. Water Quality Sampling

The information below summarizes the water quality sampling results, as required in the Monitoring and Reporting Program (General WDRs, Attachment A). Please refer to Attachment A, Section II C, for sampling and data analysis procedures.

Surface Water Sampling:

If you are not identified as participating in a Group Monitoring Program, you are responsible for individual surface water sampling as required in General WDRs, Attachment A. Sampling shall take place during or directly following each of 3 major storm events, after at least 1 inch of rain per 24 hours. Sampling events shall be at least 14 days apart.

1. Provide surface water sampling results in the table below or attach similar documentation, including any lab reports. Also attach a map of the sampling locations, including proximity of the confined facilities and land application areas.  
2. Describe your sampling methods (field equipment, test kits, measurement devices, etc.): SMOR MP Testing

| Constituent | Benchmark | Sample I.D. | Result |  
|---|---|---|---|   
| Specific conductance | Below 2000 µS/cm |  |  |  
| Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3 + NH4+) | Below 1 ppm (or mg/l) and meets calculated unionized ammonia benchmark |  |  |  
| Unionized ammonia (NH3) as calculated | 0.025 mg/l |  |  |  
| pH | 6.5-8.5 |  |  |  
| Temperature (°C) | none |  |  |

Monitoring and Reporting Program No. R2-2016-0031

Ground Water Sampling:

All facilities with manure storage ponds must conduct ground water sampling (even if you are participating in a group monitoring program). Any existing representative wells located within the confined facility, including domestic and agricultural supply wells, shall be sampled 4 times total, approximately 6 months apart. A sample must be collected in the Fall and Spring. Results of groundwater samples collected consistently with the sampling protocols and within these time frames for another purpose (e.g. for a County Health Department or by the County milk inspector) may be submitted to the Water Board instead of collecting additional samples. The sample must be representative of groundwater well conditions (i.e. not disinfected).

Groundwater samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the State Department of Health Services or a laboratory pre-approved by the Water Board staff.

| Constituent | Benchmark (municipal supply) | Sampling Results (complete below and attach lab reports) |  
|---|---|---|   
| Nitrate | 45.0 mg/l |  |  
|  |  | Fall  |  
|  | Well I.D. | Nitrate Total Coliform |  
| Total Coliform Bacteria | 1.1 MPN/100 ml |  |  
|  |  | Spring |  
|  | Well I.D. | Nitrate Total Coliform |

Note: If all sampling events have not been completed during the required time periods, future sampling is required until all wells have been sampled a total of 4 times, approximately 6 months apart.
