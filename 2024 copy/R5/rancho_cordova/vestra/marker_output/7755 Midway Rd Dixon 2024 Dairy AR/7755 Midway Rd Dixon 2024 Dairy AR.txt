map showing the discharge and sample locations; rationale for sample locations; and method of measuring discharge flows. No discharges occurred during the reporting period. All runoff flows through the tailwater return system to the storage lagoon.

12. A statement indicating if the Nutrient Management Plan (NMP) has been updated and whether the current version of the facility's Nutrient Management Plan was developed or approved by a certified nutrient management specialist as specified in Attachment C of the Order. Included in Exhibit 2, Page 69.

13. Copies of all manure/wastewater tracking manifests for the reporting period. No wastewater was transferred offsite. Manure manifests are included in Exhibit 5.

14. A statement indicating if there were any changes to third-party agreements to receive manure or process wastewater. If there were any changes, submit copies of all new or revised written agreements with each third party that receives solid manure or process wastewater from the discharger for its own use. As of 2023, dry manure from the facility is no longer transported to farmland under the same ownership. Manure is now received by a third party. The written acceptance agreement is included as Exhibit 7.

15. Copies of laboratory analyses of all discharges (manure, process wastewater, or tailwater), 
surface water (upstream and downstream of a discharge), and stormwater, including chain-ofcustody forms and laboratory quality assurance/quality control results. No discharges occurred during the reporting period. 

16. Tabulated analytical data for samples of manure, wastewater, irrigation water, soil, and plant tissue. The data shall be tabulated to clearly show sample dates, constituents analyzed, constituent concentrations, and detection limits. Laboratory analytical reports are included as Exhibit 4. 

17. Results of the Recordkeeping Requirements for the production and land application areas specified in Recordkeeping Requirements: 

## B.2.B Deficiencies. None Recorded In 2024.

B.2.c Time, date, and volume of overflow. No overflow from production area in 2024. 

## B.3.A Crop Yields. Included In Exhibit 2, Pages 4-12.

B.3.b Crop acreage, plant and harvest dates. Included in Exhibit 2, Pages 4-12. B.3.c Manure data applied to fields. Included in Exhibit 2, Pages 13 and 16-17. B.3.d Wastewater application records. Included in Exhibit 2, Pages 13-23 and Exhibit 3.

B.3.e Weather conditions during wastewater application. Included in Exhibit 3. 

B.3.j Calculations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium actually applied. Included in Exhibit 2, Pages 24-46.

B.3.l Corrective actions. None during 2024.

## Annual Reporting **Notes And Limitations**

Field 9 was not planted with the corn crop during the 2024 reporting year. No freshwater or process wastewater was applied to the forage crop on Fields 2 and 3 during the reporting year. Irrigation wells IR-6, IR-7, IR-8, IR-9 and IR-10 were not operating when irrigation well samples were collected during the 2024 reporting year. Analytical data from samples collected from these wells during previous reporting years (2021 and 2022) were used for freshwater applications from these wells. Fresh water samples are not analyzed for total nitrogen; therefore, the nitrate-nitrogen concentration for each source was entered as the total nitrogen concentration for land applications of fresh water. For each field, the volume of fresh water and process water was totaled for each quarter and entered as a single land application event for each quarter. Dates for each individual land application event are included in Exhibit 3. Due to the amount of process wastewater and fresh water that runs off the fields to the tailwater return system during irrigation events, application volumes were decreased by one-third of what was recorded in the land application records when this runoff was observed. All manure exports were entered as a single event since the operator, hauling entity, and recipient were the same for each export. The applied-to-removed nitrogen ratio exceeded 1.4 for the following fields/crops during the 2024 reporting year: The applied-to-removed nitrogen ratio for the entire dairy was 1.24 for the 2024 reporting year.

## Groundwater Reporting

Groundwater monitoring reports are submitted quarterly to the RWQCB and Solano County pursuant to the *Large Confined Animal Facility Standards* (Solano County Code, Chapter 27, Article IV, Section 27-400) under separate cover. 

## Stormwater Reporting

No stormwater discharges occurred during the reporting period.

## A. Required Attachments

The following lists the required documents that should be attached to the Annual Report when submitted .

Annual Dairy Facility Assessment Provide an Annual Dairy Facility Assessment (an update to the Preliminary Dairy Facility Assessment in Attachment A) for each reporting period. On the PDFA Final page, click on the ADFA Report button to generate an ADFA report after updating information as needed .

Manure/Process Wastewater Tracking Manifests Provide copies of all manure/process wastewater tracking manifests for the reporting period, signed by both the owner/operator and the hauler.

Written Agreements Provide copies of all new or revised written agreements with each third party that receives solid manure or process wastewater from the Discharger for its own use.

Corrective Actions Documents Provide records documenting any corrective actions taken to correct deficiencies noted as a result of the inspections required in the Monitoring Requirements of the General Order. Deficiencies not corrected in 30 days must be accompanied by an explanation of the factors preventing immediate correction.

Groundwater Monitoring Dischargers that monitor supply wells or subsurface (tile) drainage systems, or that have monitoring well systems must submit monitoring results as directed in the General Order, Groundwater Reporting Section starting on page MRP-13.

Storm Water Monitoring Dischargers that are required to monitor storm water more frequently than required in the General Order must submit monitoring results as directed in the General Order, Storm Water Reporting Section on page MRP-14.
